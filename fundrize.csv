  2019 after a 6 day hospital stay. We have currently been in the
  hospital for 15 days and have at least 3 more weeks to go followed by
  a few days at home and more 28 day cycles in the hospital. During this

"3,450",Please Help Marccelo!,U.S. Dollar,"Aug 16, 2019",of $30k goal,37,"My name is Guissela, and I'm the mother of a miraculous little boy. 
  As a mother of 2 boys with very different disabilities, there is
  nothing more terrible than seeing your child in pain over and over
  again. Well for me it was my 14-year-old son name Marccelo. After 2 spinal cord surgeries, we thought we missed the bullet
      when we were granted a miracle after a surgery that helped him get
      stronger and able to finally take his first steps with a gate
  trainer . But just like that our happy little hero's
  progress stopped.  When Marccelo started 8th grade, he suddenly began to get weaker and weaker and lost the ability
      to control his neck and lower extremities .  He also lost his spirited smile . I can still hear him asking me, ""Mommy what's going on? Why can’t I move my hands?"" I wish I could have given him a positive answer so he
  could have felt better knowing there was something we could do about
  it. Unfortunately, we got the sad news that he would need yet another
  spinal surgery; only this time it would have to be a spinal fusion and his life would be in
      jeopardy. Marccelo could lose the little strength he has left and
      be put on a ventilator for life. I am still praying
  for the courage to take that risk. Marccelo was born on November 22, 2004, the week of Thanksgiving. I
  was thankful to God for giving me such a beautiful blessing. I was
  beyond happy and felt I was the luckiest mother alive. On the day of
  his routine 9-month checkup, the doctor gave me the first of many bad
  news to come. Marccelo needed to be seen by a specialist due to the
  fact that he was very floppy. I took Marccelo for an MRI where I was
  told that he needed a spinal decompression. At only 13 months Marccelo
  had his first spinal surgery. Doctors told me he would never walk, speak, eat and that he
      would live his life permanently in a wheelchair. At
  that moment my world collapsed. I couldn't understand why this was
  happening to me. My faith was tested and I was angry at God for what
  he was doing to my child. It was the saddest day of my life. I gained strength and decided to give my son the best life I could .  I was on a mission to prove the doctors wrong. So as Marccelo grew up, I never treated him differently, nor did I
  make things easy for him. I wanted him to give it his all so he could
  become independent and succeed in life. At the age of 3, he was able to sit up, use his little hands to
      sign, speak with difficulties, eat on his own and do many things
      regular kids his age were doing. Of course, the
  walking part was a bit difficult. Regardless, Marccelo learned 2 languages, his letters, colors and numbers
      before he went to kindergarten. I was so proud, and
  happy for him. I knew there was something special about Marccelo that
  went beyond the fact he was my son. He always had an incredible way to touch hearts and inspire
  love. He is compassionate toward those suffering and has
  always been a peace maker.  This is why I believed him when he told me
  he had an encounter with God. In 2017, just before Marccelo’s second spinal decompression, he
      shared his story about a guardian angel coming to
  him.  He described his guardian angel and a message God shared with
  him about helping other children get to heaven.  He told me he met my
  grandmother who passed away 28 years before, telling me she had a
  message for me.  She called me by my pet name and said things about me
  and our relationship that Marccelo was not aware of.  I get goose
  bumps whenever I share his story.  After the experience, Marccelo went into his surgery full of faith and optimism
    with an unprecedented recovery in spite of what the doctors had told
    me to expect. That was why we thought we dodged a bullet. Marccelo has always been a kid who enjoys every second of the day, is
  outgoing, and still believes in his dream of becoming a famous video
  game player or cop!  Making sure everyone is happy, he consistently
  finds the best in the worst. He is so loving and supportive to his
  older brother who has autism...and to me, encouraging me when I would sometimes be brought to tears when
      my body would give out while trying to lift his chair into the
  car. My body, never my will, because I know I need to
  continue to be strong for him and his brother. There are no limits to what I would do to see my son smile
  again. The pain of watching him go through this is
  insurmountable.  I would take it all myself if it would lessen it for him. Today we face a bigger challenge. I am trying to ready myself and Marccelo for his third spinal
      cord decompression and fusion surgery. I am praying
  he will not have to be on a ventilator for the rest of his life, but I
  have to be prepared in case the doctors are right. I admit, it is
  overwhelming. Not just because money is a big issue but because time is running out and a lot of changes have to be made to make
      it all happen before his surgery. Following is a
  list of what we desperately need.  Fortunately, I was able to take a
  few things off the list because insurance is covering them.  Insurance
  is not covering the following: A wheelchair with a head array so Marccelo can move around independently,
        having the autonomy to continue to learn and have some fun
        playing games . An accessible mobility van because as he gets older, he is getting heavier. I can’t
        carry him anymore because it is not safe. We need a one level home with a room big enough for his medical bed, lift, and any
        other equipment he might need after surgery, also with an
        accessible bathroom so he can move around. Marccelo is not the only kid in need; we are not the only family in
  need. I'm only a very tiny percentage who are blessed to have come
  across a tremendous network of people who are encouraging me to take
  this step of reaching out to others for help. We a beyond grateful for anything you can give to help us get
      through this. A forever thankful mom, Guissela",https://fundrazr.com/Marccelo1122
"16,670",Please help fund Aimee Kelso's treatment costs,U.S. Dollar,,of $30k goal,126,"For those of you that don't know me or know me well, three
      years and four months ago my life’s journey took a sharp turn.
      With no real warning the ‘C’ word entered my world like a tidal
      wave. Over the next two months I endured test after test and scan
      after scan to determine just what I was dealing with and how to
      treat it. We prayed, we wept, we yelled, we sat quiet, we
      questioned, we doubted, we fought. Against the grain and advice of
      many, I chose non-traditional treatment. This was a life-changing
      decision. My entire lifestyle was to be changed; eating, resting,
      processing. It was a very difficult time for me, making all the
      changes necessary for my health and then having things change due
      to my choice. Changing my diet and learning my new way of eating
      was super tough; saying no to things giving myself more time for
      rest and healing was super tough; navigating work, loss of work,
      relationships and loss of relationships was super tough; but I did it. I am now faced with a not so new challenge...my cancer is
        back. I have spent the last month enduring labs, tests and scans
        to figure out what we are dealing with now. We have consulted
        with doctors from both sides of the treatment world. It has been
        a long, overwhelming process, but we have made a decision. So I
        will be heading to Germany for treatment. My Rick will be with
        me the first two weeks of what will be approximately six weeks
        of intense treatment. This leaves our precious girls here with
        Grandma and Grandpa for that time and a huge support group of
        friends to bridge the gaps! I covet your prayers as I begin this
        treatment. Protection of my girls, wisdom and patience for my
        husband, strength and peace for my mom, travel mercies,
        successful treatment, eradicating the cancer are just a few of
        the prayer requests I would ask of you. Thank you in advance for
        joining me in prayer. It is our most powerful weapon against the darkness. Psalm 46:1-7 God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble. 2 Therefore we will not fear, though the earth give way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea, 3 though its waters roar and foam and the mountains quake with their surging.[c] 4 There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, the holy place where the Most High dwells. 5 God is within her, she will not fall; God will help her at break of day. 6 Nations are in uproar, kingdoms fall; he lifts his voice, the earth melts. 7 The Lord Almighty is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress.

  participé, qui participent, et qui participeront a cette campagne de
  socio-financement. Bravo a vous tous, vous faîtes réellement une
  différence dans nos vies (surtout celle a Philip, mais aussi pour les
  gens qui l'entoure et qui s'inquiète). Près de 5,600$ ont été
  ramassé jusqu'à présent! Philip reprends du poil de la bête depuis les derniers traitement de
  chimiothérapie de cette hiver. Motivé , Philip cherche a réintégrer le
  marché du travail pour la saison estivale, afin de rester actifs et engagé. Un petit changement d'air s'impose, nous pourrons bientôt souhaiter
  la bienvenue a Philip, dans la capitale nationale ! _____________________________________________ Le 22 janvier 2019, Philip Simard-Léveillé, âgé de 21 ans, est
    diagnostiqué d’un cancer de l'hypopharynx de stade 3. Malgré la
    nouvelle, Philip garde la tête haute et les yeux pleins d’espoir; il
    est prêt à se battre. Pour ce type de cancer, les spécialistes
    estiment une durée de vie de 8 mois ainsi qu’un taux de réussite des
    traitements de chimiothérapie de 30%. Pour combattre la maladie,
    Philip a entamé ses traitements de chimiothérapie. Le type de
    traitement qu’il reçoit se fait par intraveineuse et la durée des
    traitements est de 12 heures par séance, toutes les deux semaines.
    Une fois une séance terminée, celui-ci doit immédiatement se
    retrouver en quarantaine dans un endroit aseptisé durant les 7 jours
    suivant le traitement. Suite à l’état difficile dans lequel les effets secondaires du
    traitement le laissaient, Philip a finalement pris la décision
    d’arrêter ses traitements, afin de profiter au maximum du précieux
    temps qu’il lui reste plutôt que de vivre alité et semi-conscient. Ayant perdu son travail dû au temps qu’il devait accorder à ses
    traitements et à son isolation, Philip doit toutefois continuer de
    manger et de payer son loyer et une inquiétude monétaire s’installe.
    Il est crucial pour la santé mentale de Philip de garder son
    indépendance, de rester autonome et d’avoir une vie active le plus
    longtemps possible. Une santé mentale forte est donc extrêmement
    importante afin qu’il puisse garder la tête haute. Positif, fonceur,
    travaillant, combatif et attentionné, Philip a besoin de votre aide
    afin de conserver son autonomie, mais aussi pour garder espoir. Les Fonds Les fonds que nous souhaitons recueillir pour aider Philip
    permettront de couvrir tous les besoins de base pour une période de
    12 mois: Loyer, hydro, nourriture, médicaments, déplacements,
    téléphone et Internet. Afin de conserver son autonomie ainsi qu’une
    vie active le plus longtemps possible, Philip a besoin d’amasser
    25,000$ afin de couvrir tous les frais et dépenses qui seront
    nécessaires au courant de l’année 2019. Une fois les frais de base
    couverts, Philip aura la chance de se concentrer sur sa ‘Bucket
    list’ et de vivre pleinement chaque instant. Vous pouvez aider Philip de plusieurs façons: - En apportant une contribution monétaire, peu importe le

      this campaign. All funds donated to this campaign go directly into
      Jesse and Greg's bank account only they have access to. Jessica Russman and I have been friends since we were kids.
      We are more like family. I can't remember a time when I've called
      upon her and she has not come through for me. Now SHE needs
      assistance, and I want within all my power to be at her aide. This
      one is going to take the Village though. Jesse was diagnosed with stage 3 liver cancer several months
      ago and though a successful ablation the cancer was killed, due to
      other illnesses Jesse’s liver does not regenerate. Unfortunately
      she needs a full transplant before the cancer comes back. She is
      currently on the wait list and unable to work. It takes all the
      energy she can muster to spend quality time carrying for her
      beautiful 2 year old daughter Selena. Jesse’s husband Greg is an
      amazing man and has been her rock throughout all of this while
      maintaining all the financial and household responsibilities. Needless to say the medical bills are piling up and becoming
      insurmountable. The Russman’s need help to get over this mountain
      they are about to climb? Cancer is a wicked disease that gives no
      acknowledgement to age or personal circumstance. A liver
      transplant is Jesse's only hope of survival. Jesse and Greg live 90 miles away from the nearest hospital.
      So they have to stay in a hotel with Selena when Jesse has
      treatments.  When Jesse has her transplant she will be in the
      hospital for a month and then it will take 4 to 6 months of
      recovery at home. They will need some in home care for Selena and
      Jesse so Greg can work. Greg can take a leave from work to care
      for them, but he would have to go unpaid. Any help is appreciated.",https://fundrazr.com/JesseRussman

    donations that he had received from all over the world and he just
    could not believe the support he was receiving! Thanks so much, to everyone who has come forward so far to
    make life more wonderful for Nakula. Nakulas Story He has been suffering from severe PTSD for the past few years
    and he has just recently started taking high-quality CBD, and
    medications. He is receiving Hypnotherapy and professional medical
    attention and his condition is improving, yet in order for him to
    continue receiving the care he needs and
    professional psychological counseling on a consistent basis, we will
    need some help financially to cover all his medical expenses! He has started seeing a psychologist once a week in his house
    for PTSD symptoms which are pretty severe, because he could not make
    it into town for weekly visits, a house has been set up for him in
    the countryside where he has a volunteer working and living with him
    full time that is similar to a big brother mentoring situation. He is in desperate need of consistent mental health care and
    engaging in activities with kind-hearted people encouraging him in
    his healing process, step by step progress is being made. At this time it is difficult for him to leave the house so he
    gets isolated, he tends to get paranoid, depressed and fearful, then
    he doesn't want to leave the house. All the costs involved in his care are a bit difficult to
    manage, so we have decided to reach out and ask for help for him,
    and hope that collectively we can pull together and help him out so
    he can get the medical attention he needs to get better and thrive
    in life. How You Can Help If you want to make a donation one time or on an ongoing
    monthly basis of an amount that feels comfortable, it would be
    appreciated so very much at this time! We are aspiring to raise $300 a month on an ongoing basis or a
    total of $1800 to cover his costs for 6 months for his medication
    and in-home professional counseling costs in Costa Rica. The idea is that if everyone contributes a small amount
    monthly that this can be achieved. Monthly and one time donations can be sent on Paypal to yogaofbeauty@gmail.com If you have any questions in regards to setting up a monthly
    contribution please contact us directly at the above email address. There are also options on FundRazr to remain anonymous in
    making your donations. We kindly ask you to consider donating to help Nakula at
          this time and that we stand together as friends, and family
          near and far to help heal his PTSD. If we all give what we can and share this with our various
        friends and networks then Nakula 's healing
        journey will be made so much easier by us all joining together

950,Help create balance on the planet through music,U.S. Dollar,,of $2.5k goal,12,"Hi we're Ben & Cassie, founders of Soul Fit NYC, a wellness
  company dedicated to creativity, self expression and healing for all
  people on the planet. Early this year our friend Richard Miller, a brilliant Brazilian
  guitarist approached us about a concern and idea he had to solve it.
  He told us a little known fact: over 60% of professional musicians are
  forced to end their careers early due to injury. Richard knows that it
  doesn't have to be that way. Rather than feeling sorry for himself and
  those affected by injury, he took action. He created an idea for a
  healing retreat in the healing land of Costa Rica, especially for
  guitarists. It's called ""Balanced Guitar."" It's a retreat
  that addresses injury prevention through balance. With yoga, surging,
  Tai Chi, massage, guitar instruction and healing food, Richard knows
  he could make a difference. We loved the idea! Like Richard, Cassie and I saw the possibility of
  this retreat and the huge  impact and possitive benefits this retreat
  could have for anyone who participated (musicians or not). We hit the
  ground running and made Richards dream a reality. This January 5th-13th, Balanced Guitar will happen in the healing
  land of Nosara, Costa Rice. Students from all walks of life and
  economic backgrounds will study guitar technique from brilliant
  teachers like Freddie Bryant (Professional Guitarist, Professor at
  Berklee School of Music & Tai Chi instructor) & Richard Miller
  (professor at Columbia and Driectoe of Programming for the Afro-Latin
  Jazz Alliance in NYC). Iyengar Yoga will be taught by master teacher Rosa Santana. Thai
  Massage will be provided by Cassie Fireman. Surfing lessons will be
  taught by Richard Miller himself. Organic, home cooked meals will be
  cooked by local, Costa Rican chef: Robin. All this costs money and time. We have very little time remaining and
  we have more money to raise. We especially want to raise money to help
  send students to our retreat who can't afford it on their own. Please consider making a donation today. No amount is too small (or
  large) to make a difference. If if you or someone you know would like to attend the retreat, we
  have a few spots left. Check out our website at www.BalancedGuitar.com or email ben@soulfit.nyc for more information. Pura Vida, Ben & Cassie",https://fundrazr.com/815G31
"152,820",Help James McCarthy in his battle against leukemia,U.S. Dollar,,of $100k goal,976,"How you can help: Donate to James’ care: https://fundrazr.com/campaigns/f1OA33/pay Register to be a bone marrow donor: http://www.bethematch.org/ James’ Story: On Tuesday, August 7th we were leaving the house for Rita’s birthday
  dinner when we received a voicemail from James’ doctor. She said to call immediately and left her personal cell phone
    number. As we walked, James was being his usual self:
  running down Southport Ave and acting like a healthy, happy little
  boy. Forty-eight hours later, James would be in critical
  condition, on a ventilator, and fighting for his life.  Two days after
  that James was diagnosed with an extremely rare form of Leukemia. When we called the doctor back, she shared that a routine blood test
  showed James’ white blood cell count was abnormally high and she
  wanted us to get more tests done by the Leukemia and cancer
  specialists at Lurie’s Children Hospital. To put it in
  perspective, healthy children usually have a white blood cell count of
  5,000 to 10,000. James’ was at 32,000. Thursday was the soonest appointment we could get with a hematologist
  - a doctor who specializes in diseases of the blood. The
  doctors at Lurie’s confirmed that something was not right. They wanted to get a bone marrow sample to figure out what was
  going on and the quickest way to the front of the line was to have
  James admitted. At that point, there wasn’t a high level
  of concern for James’ immediate health. We spent the day
  playing with trucks, reading books, watching “gee” (Curious George)
  and looking at cars, trucks, buses and all his favorite sights of the
  city from the hospital room window. On Friday morning at 9:30 am, James underwent a procedure to extract
  a bone marrow and a bone sample from his hip. The
  doctor’s shared what they were testing for: James likely either had
  Leukemia or an auto-immune disease. Devastation. A few hours later the oncologist (cancer doctor) called us to the
  consultation room for a discussion. She shared what was
  seemingly good news. The initial blood results had ruled
  out the most common types of Leukemia, which typically make up more
  than 99% of annual childhood Leukemia diagnosis. The
  only cancer they couldn’t rule out was a very rare form of Leukemia
  called Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, or JMML. We
  would later learn that JMML is so rare that there are currently only
  20 kids diagnosed in the U.S. While we didn’t yet have an answer for what was affecting James, we
  cautiously celebrated the news since the other options were an auto
  immune disease or pneumonia.  We were told the rest of the tests would
  likely come back on Monday. That night James’ health rapidly deteriorated. His
  temperature spiked to 104. His heart rate was racing at
  200 beats per minute. His lungs began to fail. To help his little body the nurses and doctors put him on
  oxygen and a few IVs. While we were scared – and not
  knowing what was happening – we at least had the benefit of being able
  to talk to the doctors. James didn’t. As the night progressed, the doctor’s wanted to increase his oxygen
  to help with his lungs; and to do so, he needed to be moved to the
  Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) and only they could administer
  the higher dosage. For the next 24-hours, James would not rest; his body would not let
    him. Each time he did fall asleep, he would wake up 10
  to 20 minutes later terrified and not knowing what was happening.  His
  body was in overdrive, IVs and sensors all over his body, a tube
  inserted down his nose into his stomach – how could he understand? It was excruciating. His body was being
    overworked. He was having trouble breathing. He was not getting the rest needed. He was
  pleading with all the words he had.  “All done.” “Momma.” “Up.”
  “Outside.” It was heartbreaking and terrifying to watch
  our poor little baby so scared and so sick, feeling completely helpless. The PICU team told us what we could already see.  James’ body
  could not sustain this pace on his own, so we made the decision to
  sedate and intubate him (put on a breathing machine.) It
  was mentally impossible to hear but we knew it had to be done.  We sat
  bedside with James as he was sedated and the breathing tubes inserted
  into his lungs.  This was two days after we walked into the hospital
  with a seemingly healthy little boy. Saturday brought a new bombshell. The only piece of
  good news we had received instantly disappeared. Our
  James had JMML, the rarest type of childhood Leukemia. The doctors now suspected that James did not have pneumonia. Instead it was leukemia filling his little lungs with white
  blood cells. James’ white blood cell count accelerated
  rapidly throughout the day from 30,000 (which we previously thought
  was unimaginably high) to 50,000 to 78,000 to 90,000 to 111,000 to 128,000. Our little James was now in critical condition. Some of
  the best doctors in Chicago were working with him minute-by-minute,
  hour-by-hour to keep him going. Everything had happened
  so fast that we didn’t even have time to process one bit of news
  before we had moved onto another. But we kept in mind
  one thing: if you’ve met James, you know he is a strong-willed little
    toddler. If anyone can battle this, it’s James. While James’ lungs were responding to the breathing machine, it
  wasn’t enough.  The doctors decided to move him to a
  new ventilator that could also administer anesthesia gas in addition
  to breathing for James.  This machine had to be brought up from the
  E.R. and had only been used a few times on the PICU floor over the
  past two years. We were told James may be the sickest
  patient in the hospital (438 patients) and that he was fighting for
  his life. We were grasping for straws. The doctors told us they
  were running out of things to try. We
  discussed unproven options that had never been tried on a patient as
  young as James. We signed consent forms. Fortunately, the new machine began to stabilize James and we took
  some of those options off the table.  During “rounds” the next
  morning we counted thirteen doctors and nurses around James’ room to
  get an update on his condition.  We felt like we were in the right
  place with the right level of attention from an incredibly experienced
  medical staff. We had tremendous support from family and
  friends – all rallying around James and supporting us day and night. On Sunday, August 12th- just 5 days after receiving that urgent
  call from the doctor - James started Chemo. His chemo is
  now administered twice a day. Once for
    30-minutes. Later in the day for 4-hours. He typically also requires a blood transfusion. This is in addition to the 18-25 drips of medication he is on
  every hour. As crazy as it sounds, this is only part of the story over the past
  week. There have been other challenges with blood
  pressure, his lungs filling with carbon dioxide (CO2), scary
  challenges switching him to new medical machinery, but tough little
  James is making progress. On Wednesday the 15th he moved
  to a smaller ventilator. His white blood cells are down
  to 30,000. While still on anesthesia, James has been resting in bed with his
  night time puppy, Curious George stuffed animal and a pacifier in one
  hand and his favorite toy truck in the other. We have
  been reading James books, which is very difficult while keeping your
  emotions in check. James has a long fight in front of him. It’s scary to
  think about all the challenges ahead but right now we are focused on
  today. One step at a time, then we will tackle the next target. Ultimately, the only cure for JMML is a bone marrow transplant, in
  addition to extensive chemotherapy over the coming months until we
  find the appropriate donor match. If you want to see if
  you would be a match for James, please register at the website below. Nearly 5,000 kids will be diagnosed with Leukemia this year. There are a lot of kids like James out there whose only hope is
  to find a good donor match. You can do it from your own
  home and it’s as easy as swabbing the inside of your cheek. Please visit: http://www.bethematch.org/ You can learn more about JMML at: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_myelomonocytic_leukemia Please keep James in your thoughts and prayers.  He’s the
  sweetest little boy you’ll ever meet. We can’t wait to
  hear his voice again. To see his kind blue eyes. To have him blow us a kiss with a smile. I love
    you James. You can donate to James’ care at https://fundrazr.com/campaigns/f1OA33/pay",https://fundrazr.com/f1OA33

  We have sent a letter of medical necessity and applied twice for a
  lift to Ryan’s Medicaid but have been denied even after appealing. His
  12th birthday is coming up on June 21st and the only thing I can think
  of that he needs is a manual ceiling lift. This will help us safely

  to lift him especially when he is wet from the shower. He also goes
  many places throughout the week (church, therapy, and family outings)

"26,060",Urgent Support Needed for Tony Dowling's Cancer Journey!,Australian Dollar,"Jul 1, 2019",of $60k goal,71,"Hi, my names Matt my wife and I have been friends with Tony and Tracy for nearly twenty
    years. They are a beautiful family and it was such a shock when I
    got the call from Tony recently telling me of his cancer diagnosis! I’m sure most of you have been following his journey as we have
    and are sending a constant stream of love, positive thoughts and
    prayers their way. I spoke again with Tony last week and heard the n ews of
    the new diagnosis and upgrade from stage 1 to stage 4. Truly heartbreaking to hear, but Tony is as positive and
    faith-filled as always, a true inspiration, we stand strong with
    them believing for a full recovery! He told me briefly of some of the struggles of dealing with the
    unexpected expenses and also the obvious loss of income etc. but
    expressed that he knows that God has it all under control and that he is confident of a positive outcome. After our chat I got off the phone and probably like many of you
    who are not physically located near Tony and Tracy in Sydney
    Australia, I thought to myself, there has to be something we can do to help, so I have set up this campaign in
    the hope that you will all join us in standing together to help make
    a massive difference to Tonys journey! Following is a snapshot of the Dowling family, a link to Tony’s
    journey so far which you can follow and the reasons why our
    donations are so very vital and impactful at this time for them... Tony is 46 years old and has been married to
  Tracy for 19 yrs. They live on the northern beaches of Sydney with
  their two boys Max 16 and Noah 14. The family is heavily involved in
  local basketball through the boy's school and the Manly representative
  level comps. Tracy is involved at the boy's school and helps
  co-ordinate and manage multiple basketball teams. Tony has a background as a school teacher,
  business entrepreneur and currently works in training and software
  development. They are active members of the local community, and
  church and love travelling, family time and adventures of any kind. Tony and Tracy have impacted the lives of so many people around the
  globe and locally with their big hearts and generous souls. We all have been positively influenced by this amazing couple in some
  shape or form, through either school, community, business or church
    life. Here is a link where you can follow Tony’s journey and progress: https://www.mylifeline.org/invitation/FOTY/b53c54fcc2abfed6f3d977439df0c4c309e98f36fff675b0772a480f52894be2 How we can help: Tony has just had surgery to remove bowel cancer which has also
  spread to his right lung. Tony’s diagnosis has now jumped from stage 1 to stage 4! This means that it is full steam ahead for aggressive chemotherapy
  treatment for the next 6 mths, followed by lung surgery around
  November 2019. They are in the process of trying to access some insurance funds, but
  there is a 3 mth waiting period that is not covered and then funds
  will still only cover 3/4 of normal income. On top of that, there are all the additional medical bills, hospital
  expenses, gap payments, medications and day to day additional expenses
  that come with this type of treatment... We want Tony, Tracy and the boys to be able to focus on the important
  things and keep any additional stress to a minimum. We would like to
  provide enough to get them through this 4 month transition period and
  also give them a buffer so that there is not a financial burden and
  pressure on them over the next 6 months. We would like to enable Tracy to not have to take up any additional
  work to cover any shortfall and added expenses, but be able to spend
  the time with Tony and attend to all the necessary appointments and
  give him all the required care and attention needed at this time. After calculating the amount needed to cover their everyday expenses
  keeping them afloat and to keep life as normal as possible, plus
  enough to help cover their ongoing medical costs for the next 6
  months, we have set a goal to raise $60K. Anything above that will go towards any additional ongoing medical
  expenses and treatment required. We kindly ask you to consider donating to help bless Tony
        and his family at this time as they link arms and stand together
        with friends, and family near and far to fight this nasty thing
        head on! If we all give what we can and share this with our various
        friends and networks then Tony and His family’s journey will be
        made so much easier by us all joining together to show how much
        we care! Thank you all for your thoughts, prayers and generous donations... God Bless!!",https://fundrazr.com/f1TtQ0

  returned. It was hard to receive this news before Christmas, but love

  hoping the drug that worked so powerfully 2 years ago would bring him
  into remission again. Instead, his disease spread exponentially. While still mid-course in the Venetoclax treatment, we

And, if you haven’t heard already, please visit my website at https://peanutbutterandcancer.com/ for the full shebang. For those of you that may not be able to visit the website... Here’s the skinny. I have brain cancer. I know what you’re feeling, shock, me too
    when I first found out. It started when I was in North Carolina visiting my mom who was
    having a benign brain tumor removed on October 18th. (She’s
    recovering great.) While there, I began having some difficulty
    reading, super aggressive vomiting, and ultimately a raging
    headache. This lasted for a couple of days. My Nanny fortuitously
    took me to the ER in our hometown to, at the very least, get some
    fluids. During that visit, the docs did a CT scan which showed
    evidence of pressure on my brain and the team recommended further
    testing. So I flew back to Denver, CO on October 23. Noah (my
    husband) and I went to Porter ER for follow up. An MRI revealed a
    mass in my brain and they suggested immediate surgery. On 10/25 I
    underwent a successful surgery to remove the visible portions of the
    25mm mass and the tissue was sent out for testing. I was released
    from the hospital on 10/28. On November 1st, I found
    out I have the deadliest of all 120 types of brain tumors, Stage 4
    Glioblastoma (GBM). And... about 3 weeks ago we received some exciting news.  I tested
  positive for cytomegalovirus (CMV).  Which means the CVM is
    found in 60% of all GBMs.  It's also found in the stem cells of all
    GBMs.  This gives us reason to think the cause of the cancer could
    be from a virus. Which we are currently treating with antiviral
    medications. So, in a world of medicine that's not quite sure what
    to do with GBMs, this gives us a place to start. So, we got some fighting to do, huh? Here’s what treatment looks like. First I radically changed my diet (bye bye sugar and peanut butter) Then we started taking every supplement under the sun that is
    rumored to have anti-cancer properties. After consulting our naturopathic oncologist and nutritionist,
    we've narrowed down what supplements work for me.  Luckily, I've
    been able to take less pills. Yay! We've done the radiation and the first round of chemo. I'll
    still be doing small doses of chemo for the next 6 months. I’ve also been doing a number of alternative and spiritual
    treatments: sound bath, reiki, acupuncture Soon I’ll be starting Optune. (This is the part where I shave my
  head). You can check it out here if you want more info ... https://www.optune.com/ This is what I'll look like with the Optune on What I need from you. Send positive vibes. If you believe in Quantum Physics, you know
    energy can heal. Forward any contacts or resources you may have surrounding
    successful GBM treatments. Consider a monetary donation. Unfortunately, stupid cancer isn't

"5,460",Miles Turns Two,U.S. Dollar,"Jun 16, 2019",of $5k goal,48,"Miles was born at 9:35PM on June 8, 2017 at Advocate Lutheran General
  Hospital, and it was quickly discovered that something wasn't quite
  right. Miles was gasping for air and showing signs of seizures, and he
  was almost immediately whisked away to the NICU for what would be his
  home for months to come. After four, long days of tests, x-rays, and
  more pokes than one newborn should ever have to endure, it was
  discovered that Miles's ALP levels were ""immeasurable"" and
  many of his bones were so under-mineralized, that they didn't even
  show up on x-ray. While we didn't have genetic confirmation at this
  point (that would come a few weeks later), Miles was diagnosed with
  Infantile Hypophosphatasia - or HPP for short. With his essentially
  nonexistent ALP, Miles is unable to mineralize bones properly. His
  body also struggles with breaking down B6, which cause him to suffer
  from B6 responsive seizures. Thankfully for Miles and the rest of us,
  there is an enzyme replacement therapy that was recently approved by
  the FDA. Miles received his first injection on June 23. It took about two months to start to see some development in Miles's
  bones. His skull that was referred to as ""bone buds"" when he
  was born was finally starting to mineralize. His ribs that looked like
  toothpicks on the first x-ray were showing some strength. We had no
  idea for these first couple of months if the enzyme replacement
  therapy would work. And these x-rays were the first real sign of hope
  because by the end of July, Miles had tired himself out from his
  short, shallow breathing and found himself intubated. After much
  discussion with his doctors, Miles had surgery to get his trach and
  g-tube on August 9. Now you'd think that with a ventilator helping him breathe and the
  enzyme replacement therapy helping him mineralize his bones, we would
  have started to see marked improvement in Miles. But that wasn't the
  case. Miles continued to struggle. Growing bones is apparently quite
  painful (I mean even the great Harry Potter thought so). After some
  advocating by his wonderful nurses, Miles was given a morphine drip
  for the pain. He was also on a number of sedative drugs. It took until
  November, at over 5 months old, for Miles to be weaned off of his IV
  drips and have his central line removed. Even after his central line
  was removed, it took until December for him to be weaned completely
  off of morphine. And on January 16, 2018, after 222 days in the NICU, Miles was
  finally stable enough to come home. But this wasn't the end of Miles's
  medical adventures. Miles came home 100% ventilator and oxygen
  dependent. He also was fed entirely through a g-tube and never took a bottle. For the past year and a half, Miles has made major strides. He's
  learned to sit unassisted, to crawl, and even bear weight on his once
  broken legs. He's grown strong enough to start weaning off the vent.
  And he's begun taking some food by mouth. But Miles still has a
  lifetime of obstacles to overcome thanks to his HPP. For Miles's second birthday, we are raising money for Soft Bones.
  Soft Bones is an amazing organization that has helped us so much in
  Miles's first two years of life. They offer support and resources to
  HPP patients and families. They fund research to help better the lives
  of patients with HPP, and hopefully to one day fine a cure for HPP. We
  are honored to give back to this organization that has given us so much. For more information on HPP or Soft Bones, visit SoftBones.org",https://fundrazr.com/milesturnstwo

     Some of you may be aware in April of this year my mother, Judy, was
    told by her physicians that the breast cancer she fought hard to rid
    her body of in 2008 through 2009 has returned and is attacking her
    bones.  It is currently on a femur, in her tailbone,  shoulder,
    neck, some parts of the spine, and her lower skull. We were excited
    to learn through scans none of her organs have been affected. And we
    want to keep it that way! She began a 10 day treatment of radiation two weeks ago. Now she is
  waiting for her white blood cell count to recover so she may begin the
  oral chemo treatment called Ibrance. Ibrance is a very costly
  prescription. After insurance, it costs $2235.00 for a 21 day supply.
  This prescription could possibly need to be administered for the next
  year. I hope that we can all rally around my parents at this time so
  they will not have to refinance their home in order to pay for this
  lifesaving medicine. The cost of this one drug for a year is  close to
  $30,000. The first month is covered and then we have 30 days to band
  together before the bills hit for each new month’s prescription.  This
  is not including her other medications and treatments. My mom is determined to win this battle once more. Tom and Judy are
  confident the Lord is walking her through this journey  and the
  Father’s amazing healing works will be demonstrated mightily. Thank you for your donations and prayers! Every little bit will help
  my mom continue to fight the good fight. Please follow this page at
  the bottom to keep up with updates. If Ibrance is discontinued,
   whatever monies are raised will go to any other medical expenses my

    creative process and its many forms. I love trying new things
    because I'm always up for a good challenge. However, I'm facing a
    pretty big challenge of a different sort currently and would really
    appreciate your help. I've lived with mobility issues since the age of
    nine, because of multiple spinal issues, but mostly due to multiple
    arachnoid cysts filled with fluid at the base of my spine which are
    compressing my nerves. I've had surgery to drain it in 2001, and it
    was stable for many years but recent MRIs have shown that it's
    become filled with fluid once again. Medically, I'm figuring out
    what my options are at the moment. In October of 2015, I woke up to feeling like there was a
    piece of tape stuck to the bottom of my right foot. Since then I've
    had multiple EMGs and MRIs done and am still left with not a lot of
    answers or solutions. Due to a combination of my complicated case
    and the scar tissue from my previous surgery, multiple neurosurgeons
    have told me they're not comfortable attempting another... so I'm
    left with a situation I need to find my own solution for. To get an idea of what I'm working with here, here's a picture
    of a ""healthy"" spine vs my spine: If you feel like deciphering doctor language, here's my most
    recent MRI report: ( Right-click on the pic > Open image in new tab to see it at full resolution) In summation: YIKES. What does this mean for me currently? Chronic Pain Numbness in my right foot makes it so I can't
      feel the floor when I go to take a step, therefore, balance issues I haven't been able to walk without a cane
      since 2016 I'm not able to walk very far, even with a
      cane, so I've been essentially housebound for these last few
      years, and boy, would I love not to be! I'm reliant on my brother and sister-in-law
      for anything that requires me to leave the house. (They are the
      best and don't mind, but I'd rather not have to!) So... What would the Alinker do for me? I'd be able to leave the house by myself(!!!) I could go get the mail! Grocery stores would once again be within my reach Unlike a wheelchair, I'd be able to rebuild
      and maintain muscle tone in my legs Be able to have a conversation while walking
      again instead of using all my energy focusing on trying not to fall I could enjoy my time at events, festivals,
      family trips, etc. without feeling like I'm slowing everyone down Having a seat with me at all times would be a
      dream come true I could explore the neighborhood and all its
      cool historic sites I could take my nieces to the park I could walk the family dog I would be closer to being as cool as Selma Blair It really would give me so much freedom back,

  after less than a month and he has been slowly awakening from this state. He has begun to move both legs, move his eyes ( visual
  tracking) and to turn his head. Very positive steps forward. He
  responds to touch and stimuli and a few times- though not yet
  consistent-we saw a smile......it was beautiful to see! Julianne, Jasper's mom (03/29/16) What we do know is that his recovery is going to be a long
  road. He is facing years of rehabilitation, initially in a
  facility equipped to deal with rebuilding his physical  and cognitive
  abilities. This is going to be costly and we need your help . Your generous donations will be
  used to ensure that Jasper is able to get the care he needs to reclaim

"9,349",Road to Healing: Help Col with treatment and life!,U.S. Dollar,,of $42k goal,95,"A Message from Maria ... When I picture my friend Col, I envision light—a beautiful, warm,
  loving light. Her aura glows with this willingness to understand and empathize. That’s one of the reasons why this disease she has been battling is
  so difficult for me to come to grips with. It seems to be literally
  eating away at the insides of her physical body, and yet her mind and
  her spirit still keep glowing—still keep pushing on—despite the daily
  obstacles she faces. Col does not like to complain so she doesn't want us to list all of
  her symptoms, which are many. When you see her smiling and laughing
  with you, she's doing it amidst great pain and discomfort. Often it
  feels like she's dying. A number of her doctors don't take insurance and need to be paid out
  of pocket (just one office visit can cost $600!) and the treatment
  they prescribe is also not covered by insurance. She has been sick for
  numerous years so you can imagine the toll that that takes. Her illness is not something you'd know about unless you are close to
  her. But it's very serious and it severely impedes her quality of
  life. And her closest friends and family are very concerned— *We want her to be with us for years to come!* Please join me in doing what you can to help Col win this war within
  her body and pave her road to healing. A Message from Sue Elliott ... Have you ever met somebody — even online — and instantly loved that person? I’m not talking about lust. I’m not even talking about appreciation. What I mean is some sort of deep, soul-level recognition. A
  feeling like “home,” like “It’s so good to see you again after all
  these years! I do so adore you!” That’s how I felt about Col the first time I saw her photo and
  read a comment she had posted online in a business-oriented group
  years ago. Since then, I’ve gotten to know Col “better,” and I still have
  that same feeling. She’s like a cross between an angel, a friend and a sister! We have amazing conversations in which we both let go of all
  kinds of “stuff” that no longer serves us and we experience huge AHA moments! If you had asked me a year or so ago how I felt about Col, I
  would have told you that she’s a dear, dear friend, at the very least. And yet, as close as we had gotten on so many levels, I
  had NO idea that Col was often in severe physical pain. Not only does she not complain about pain, she’s so genuinely
  joyful and inspired and inspiring, it never dawned on me that she
  could be anything but energetic and “healthy.” Her very being exudes well-being! Col wrote a beautiful blog post that illustrates her approach to
  life and living, even in the midst of pain... even in the midst of
  illness. Please take a couple minutes to be inspired by the beauty of
  Col’s approach to — and dance with — life: Dancing in the Rain . Throughout the pain and the illness, Col has been giving to
  others in the most magnificent way. She created a FREE program called Magical Medical Mystery Tour , in which she
  interviewed amazing healers of all kinds. She created a forum in which
  these experts shared their wisdom freely with anyone who cared to
  participate. The gift of these interviews continues to unfold within
  me and, I’m sure, within all who were game for the adventure. So when Col told me that she now has one or two Western medical
  doctors for EACH of her organs! —and as much as she loves and
  appreciates them, Western medicine doesn’t seem to be working for her
  particular illness — I didn’t have to ask if she had tried natural and
  alternative healing modalities. I knew she had — with joy and
  enthusiasm and insight ... And yet, her body still has more to say — more insights to
  reveal — and it wants to reveal those insights and that wisdom through
  biological medicine. Col has received many “nudges” from the universe
  pointing her in that direction — and this is a woman who KNOWS how to
  listen to and dance with the universe. Like all great dances, it’s a two-way experience. There is
  giving and receiving. And there is constant expansion. One of the most obvious — and magnificent — benefits of this
  expansive dance with the universe and with pain and illness has been
  creativity. Everything that Col learns and experiences goes deep
  within her being and comes out as ART! Art with spirit. Art with soul. Art with purpose. And art that
  is infused with the energy of healing and a return to balance and wholeness! If you feel inspired, I encourage you to listen to your soul.
  Listen to your body. Listen to your inner response to Col’s artwork.
  And if something resonates deeply within you, please purchase it. Not only will you be bringing something beautiful and powerful
  into your own home or office, you will be helping to make Col’s dream
  come true, the universe-directed dream to receive biological treatment. I know I will be buying several pieces of Col’s work for myself
  and to give as gifts. And I know I will not be alone. Col is so loved
  by so many! Sue Elliott Founder/Editor-in-Chief of Law of Attraction Magazine www.LovingMyself.com ..................................................

488,Trevor's Top Surgery,U.S. Dollar,,of $2k goal,8,"My name is Trevor Clifford. I am 21 years old, and I am transgender.
  I have been on testosterone for 15 months. Starting testosterone has
  changed my life for the better and relieved a lot of my dysphoria, but
  I still continue to struggle with the suffocating dysphoria of how my
  chest looks. There are times where I wear my binder too long even
  though I know I shouldn't, but the anxiety and grief when I take it
  off is sometimes too overwhelming. Early on I would bind incorrectly
  without realizing the danger of that. Due to that my sternum has gone
  inward. Getting Top surgery will relieve a lot of my dysphoria, and
  help me from continuing to harm my body. I recently received the best news of my life, which is getting top
  surgery. My surgery date is April 18th. Although my insurance is
  covering a lot of my surgery I will not be able to go back to work for
  4-6 weeks after. I am currently working and going to school. I do not
  live with my family, or have the support from them. My biggest concern
  is that I won't be able to pay the bills I have since I will be out of
  work. I have added up the total cost of two months of bills as well as
  added in the cost of follow up appointments for surgery to get the
  amount I need to reach by my surgery date. I have saved as much as I
  could and I will continue to save until the day of the surgery. I'm
  currently working two jobs to insure that I can cover my current bills
  while I also go to school. I greatly appreciate any help I can to get
  this life changing surgery.",https://fundrazr.com/b1STVc
"10,670",Stan Romanek Medical /Life FundRazer,U.S. Dollar,,of $15k goal,145,"I'm adding the story behind this fund raiser so you may
    understand who, what, when, where and most importantly why. Who: Stan Romanek is an ordinary man who experiences
    Extraordinary events. Stan is an innocent individual who has been
    convicted of a horrendous crime. A crime against children. Stan
    maintains his innocence, and his friends and family stand by his
    side knowing he would never harm a child, not even by looking at
    pictures of abuse by others. Stan is a father,stepfather, step-Papa, husband, brother, son,
    friend and a lifeline of understanding & support to many people
    around the world. What: It all began in Dec. 2000 when Stan witnessed and
    documented his first UFO. His experiences of contact with ETs/UFO's
    still continues just not as often. More....What: Over the past 17 years Stan has endured threats,
    physical assaults, being shot at, called a fraud and worse. Stan has also received love, praise, thanks, respect, from
    around the world, and according to some a little fame. Netflix
    movie, EXTRAORDINARY:The Stan Romanek Story is a documentary about
    his life and experiences. In 2013 A detective named Koopman arrived at Stan's home with
    a search warrant, an armed SWAT Team, and 2 persons from a forensics
    lab. The team spent 2 1/2 hours in his home, searching. They found
    no evidence of what they were searching for. ( What...Child Porn) No
    disk, no jump drive, no picture, or any trace on any computer!!!! When: April 2013...search warrant When: February 2014 Stan was arrested. He spent 12 hours in
    jail. That's how long it takes to bail someone out. When: 4 1/2 years after the search warrant, August 2017 Stan
    was found guilty of possesion of CP by a 12 member jury. Stan does not blame the jury. They weren't give all of the
    evidence in this case. They weren't allowed to know that Det.
    Koopman had faced his own felony charges in 2016 for basically lying
    to a judge in a murder case pre-trial. He was found not guilty.
    However, the detective was placed on a Brady list. A list for police
    officers who lie in their official capacity. No one could tell the jury about this in Stan's trial, they
    didn't know of the other cases the Det. lied in or that there were 2
    civil lawsuits against the detective. A lot of evidence and witnesses provided for Stan's defense
    was not allowed or were limited in what they could say. This is not how the justice system us supposed to work.
    Innocent people found guilty and guilty people found innocent???? Where: Loveland Colorado, Larimer County. Why: WHY DID THIS HAPPEN TO STAN?? The reason is simple. Silence the messenger! Our therory is that the evidence found 10 months after the
    search warrant was planted. The evidence proves our therory!!!
    Evidence not seen by the jury! How: Malicious activity!!! Virus with backdoor access, a bad
    cop, a dark agency bent on silencing Stan, someone who simply didn't
    agree with Stan's message of the ET/UFO reality????? Who knows!?! The end of this Story is still to be written. On October 19, 2017 Stan will appear in court for sentencing. Nothing can change that fact. The judge is a good judge, and
    Stan's fate is in her hands. What can be done to finish this Story? Please share this
    fundraiser. Donate whatever amount you can, and assist Stan in
    getting an appeal. Justice for Stan is our mission. Do you Stand with Stan? #IStandWithStan PAYPAL Donations: lisaromanek@yahoo.com Thank you, blessings, love and gratitude to you all!",https://fundrazr.com/d1HMsc
"4,985",Please Help Us Support Bob's Recovery,Canadian Dollar,,of $25k goal,26,"HELP BOB GET HIS PROSTHETIC LEG, GET OUTDOOR WHEELS AND MOVE
    TO A WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE APARTMENT We have collectively started this fundraiser for Bob; our Dad,
    Grandpa, Cousin, Partner and Friend who is living with diabetes and
    is now facing his third amputation. Over the past 6 years, Bob’s health has declined dramatically
    going from managing through diet to PD at home 24/7, to in and out
    of ER, being admitted on and off to his recent amputations. The disease is currently expressing itself with acute renal,
    liver failure, high blood pressure and debilitating vascular
    cognitive as well as peripheral artery disease. In November 2018 Bob
    endured two amputations, first a toe which didn’t heal then soon
    afterwards, the below the knee amputation. Bob is now facing the amputation of his other leg which will
    cause us to have to move again. The Fundrazr funds will be managed in a trust. For all the details
  about Bob's budget and health challenges please scroll to the end. Read on for Bob's story and letters from our family... Please help us help Bob . In the next 1- 6 months, he’s facing new costs for a Prosthetic
    leg, outdoor electric wheelchair (his current one is ok indoors but
    can’t go up a hill or keep up with someone walking slowly), a move
    to a wheelchair accessible apartment, payments on a van with a lift
    and the ever increasing list of medications that are not covered.
    We’re posting the details of upcoming expenses below. All
    contributions will be going into a trust managed by our friend and
    lawyer - Amanda Rose. We’ll be posting photos and Amanda will be
    posting updates on how the funds are used. Bob is still hopeful to
    eventually recover from current challenges in order to meet the
    requirements to undergo the kidney transplant. The costs and debt have been piling up and it’s overwhelming.
    Bob's close circle of family has been helping and his partner Fitu
    is working 3 side jobs plus her F/T position as a site resident
    manager, allowing her to care for Bob at home. Until now, we’ve all
    been pretty quiet about this but it’s just not possible anymore. Any help you can offer will be a
    huge help - whether it’s making a donation of any size, commenting
    below, sharing Bob’s story in person, on the phone, in email or
    social media. Let’s get Bob’s story to everyone who knows him on the
    BC coast and beyond. BOB’S STORY Those of you who are lucky enough to share in Bob’s life, you
    know it’s an adventurous one. Fisherman, Father, Friend. Family. Bob
    was born on February 2nd, 1956 and grew up in Burnaby while he spent
    his summers fishing in Alert Bay. As a kid, Bob was fortunate to be invited aboard to join the
    crew on the Cape Cook by Gilbert Cook Sr.. Eventually young Gilbert
    took over and he stayed for a few seasons. Bob also crewed salmon on
    the Jean W., Bruce Luck, Good Partner and the Sleep Robber. He also
    fished herring on the Jean W, Dawn Treader and Waverley. Bob says,
    “I ran the Sea Castle and a few other gillnetters. I can’t recall
    the names but that is just where my brain is going…” Whether on land or water, Bobby is a hard worker. He takes
    utmost pride in caring for his family, his children and
    grandchildren: the loves of his life.  He’s the Bob of all trades,
    and well, master of them, too. While on land Bob is a painter and a
    carpenter and has done repairs, maintenance and renovations from his
    own apartments to large condo complexes. He’s known for his
    attention to meticulous detail...everything must be totally squared off! While on the water, Bob is in his element. Happy, working hard,
    visiting and laughing with people on other boats,  telling stories
    and fooling everyone with his jokes - always delivered as true
    stories with a straight face! FITU & BOB  - OUR CONNECTION Mine and Bob’s long history began with our grandparents.  Our
    grandfathers were seine fisherman from Alert Bay. Our grandmothers
    were best friends who raised their children together in a small town
    and later moved to Vancouver as their families grew in numbers and
    age so they could attend school in the city. Our mothers remained friends throughout their lives and raised
    their children together. Bob and I grew up together, always friends.
    We both went our separate ways, married others and raised our
    children only seeing each other at various family events or during
    the fishing seasons. In 2009, both single, our paths met again; this
    time we brought with us our huge mixed bag of beautiful children.
    Now after 11 years, our family includes grandchildren from our kids
    and our closest friends. As you can see in the photos, the kids are
    Bob’s joy and they feel the same way. Dad, love you from Courtney – Honestly, I am not
  really sure where to start. Not a single day passes by that I don’t
  think of you, even though I don’t see you as often as I would like.
  Bey, Maddox, Laila and I miss you daily and wish we lived closer so we
  could spend more time with you. You have always been the “rock” in my
  life and I just want you to know that if I lived closer, I would
  strive to be the “rock” in yours. You entered my life when I was a baby and even though I was not
  biologically your child, you always treated me as though I was. You
  raised me as though I was your own and I never questioned that I
  wasn’t (besides wondering why my hair was dark and Britt’s and Nick’s
  was blond LOL). Even when I learned that you weren’t my biological
  father, I never felt that you were anything other than my dad. YOU
  were the one who helped teach me to walk, talk, ride a bike, drive,
  etc. Through every milestone in my life, YOU were there. YOU were my rock. Some of my best memories are the times we spent on the fishing
  boat. Bringing in the nets, playing with sea creatures, scrubbing the
  decks and beautiful sunsets taught me more about life then you will
  ever know. Seeing killer whales so close to the boat we could touch
  them was such an amazing experience that has remained in my mind all
  these years. Although the large storms and trying to find other boats
  to tie up to were scary as a child, you always made us feel secure and
  safe. I wouldn’t trade these memories in for the world. I know my teenage years were not easy for anyone, but you
  handled them like a champ. I was a terrible teenager, but you NEVER
  treated me as such. The nights of me failing to come home, my
  dishonesty, and the many bad decisions I made never changed the way
  you treated me or felt about me. One of your best attributes is that
  you NEVER judge people. Many times during this rough time in my life I
  felt judged by people but never by you. No matter what I did or didn’t
  do you were always there. I remember the many times you came to find
  me and when you did, there were no questions asked. No judgement. No
  yelling. You accepted me as I was and never pushed me away. I could
  tell you anything without fear of judgement or being in trouble. I
  want you to know that without your support during this time, I am not
  sure that the outcome would ended up as good as it did. Again, you
  were always my rock. It is because of your support that I am
  where I am today – happily married with 2 wonderful kids. Bey
  considers you as a father and has the utmost respect for you. Maddox
  and Laila ask about grandpa all the time. They always ask how grandpa
  is doing and when he will come down to visit next. Maddox especially
  understands what grandpa is going through and is so empathetic and
  helpful it amazes me. We all understand this time in your life has taken a physical
  and emotional toll on you. Like you always told me “life isn’t easy”.
  You have so much support and love that if we all work together, we can
  help make your “new” life as easy and enjoyable as possible for you. I want to say thank you to Fitu. I know this has also been
  physically and emotionally hard on you as well. Dad is extremely lucky
  to have you in his life. The amount of time you dedicate towards dads
  care is incredible and you do it all without any complaint. I know you
  are his “rock”. You are one of the most selfless people I know and
  from the bottom of my heart, I appreciate everything you have done and
  continue to do for my dad. My rock. For Dad, love Brit - I often reflect on the
  continuous presence you have in my life – the days, weeks and years
  through which your duty as my father has brought nothing but pure
  enjoyment. You are a support of strength, encouragement and
  discipline. Your love is endless - you are a man to be admired. From a young age, I can remember the many hours you spent
  playing with me, the thousands of kisses goodnight and the countless
  trips out for meals when dinner on the table was “questionable”. I
  recognize the moments for which you were and are there – no matter the
  sacrifice. You give me all the love, time, care and appreciation that
  you have available. I am grateful for the countless phone calls and
  advice given when I have no one else to turn to. As though it was yesterday, I remember you gifting me my first
  car and shortly after that helping me shop for the car of my dreams.
  Truth be told, I had no idea what the process entailed and was a
  little overwhelmed in the moment, but as with every other milestone in
  my life you held my hand and walked me through it all. By the end of
  the day, I had a car of my own and the freedom to take me where I
  needed to go. That freedom took me to university, where you continued to
  provide your infinite support of home cooked meals and a roof over my
  head, albeit not always with walls. The day I graduated your sported a
  look of “honored father”, one that boasted how proud you were of me
  and shouted to the world that you had all the confidence and trust in
  it to guide me through to the next journey in my life. Not many years after that, you waited (not so) patiently outside
  of my delivery room where you were blessed with one of the most kind,
  loving and caring little boys you will ever have the pleasure of
  knowing. I knew right away that the bond between you two would be
  special and that your firm and gentle touch was as loving as could be.
  Again, those tears in your eyes told me just how proud you were of me
  in that particular moment in time. From there we traveled to Los Cabos where you met me in my suite
  to walk me down the aisle on my wedding day. Neither one of us knew
  what to do, how slowly we should walk, where we should look or how to
  link arms, and just like that the moment flew by. We got to the
  gazebo, you blinked back tears and you couldn’t say a word. The
  message was clear – you were proud. Each of the milestones mentioned above, along with many more
  occurred as I transitioned from a child to an adult. Each symbolized a
  moment when I needed to be guided in order to grow. Your loyalty,
  confidence and unconditional support has moved mountains in my life,
  and there are still mountains left to move, so don’t think for a
  second that your job is done! I need you in the years ahead, and to
  play your role with fineness. I need you more than ever. I often reflect on the continuous presence you have in my life –
  the days, weeks and years through which your duty as my father has
  brought nothing but pure enjoyment. You are a support of strength,
  encouragement and discipline. Your love is endless - you are a man to
  be admired. From Jojo Our Creature As Carson’s’ nanny, I serendipitously, etc. etc. etc. met Bobby
  April 2016. I was the last to know there was an existing established
  relationship between my “ward” and Bobby and Fitu. Why are these
  people cooing over my sweetie pie in the elevator? How do they know
  his name? Why is my sweetie pie responding so lovingly to these
  strangers? Thank you, Bobby for… (loving Little as his own / loving me
  as his own.) One random Tuesday, this familiar stranger Bobby invited me and
  my sweetie pie to spend the day at the beach, which happen to turn out
  to be the first of many. I am Jody, but I happily spent many warm, sunny beautiful days
  as “Brittany” while our sweetie pie vacillated between being Carson in
  flesh and nostalgically baby Linden. Other times our sweetie pie was
  Baby Nick, other days he was Maddox. Some days I was Courtney. We sure
  had to keep an eye on curious Baby Wayne! I hadn’t yet met Bobby’s
  children, but I felt a comfortable closeness to each of them. I knew
  and felt Carson and I were safe and loved with this familiar
  stranger…the three of us journeying through time and space Jody and
  Carson, and Wayne and Courtney and Brittany and Nick and Skye and
  Maddox and Laila and Linden loved up and safely kept by Bobby, their
  Father, their Grandpa…this familiar stranger, my friend. As Summer turned to Fall things got real: Bobbly learned
  feminism and Jody learned to bite her tongue. Let’s face it, social
  graces between Bobby and I fell quicker and more plentiful than the
  autumn leaves. I gifted Bobby with the privilege of gender politics
  and all that is Feminism. I was gifted in return with the ins and outs
  of Republicans. Poor Fitu had to share her own living room with Fox
  News and Bobby and Jody and our thoughts Hawkins cheesies and our
  opinions and for some reason I don’t think either Bobby or I kept
  things to a dull roar. From Deb - Meeting you “My Bob” (as my kids call you
  ) 6 years ago , we would never have imagined what a great influence
  you would have on our life. All the time you spent with my girls especially Iylah who came
  out of her shyness so quickly with you and Fitu, coming over when our
  sink flooded in the middle of the night , helping me scrape paint off
  my window sills due to my lousy painting ability, bbqing us chicken
  burgers, being my go to guy when it came to a lot of things and so on.
  You will never know how much I appreciate everything you’ve done for
  us. You are a perfect example of a wonderful Grandpa , Dad and
  friend is and we are lucky to call you family. Our love for you
  is immense and we adore and support you always! Deb From Amaya - I don’t even know where do begin. You
  are awesome all around I wanna say thank you for everything you’ve
  done for me, my mom, and my sisters. I know it may seem I don’t
  acknowledge anymore lol but know I love you and appreciate everything
  you’ve done for us From Zaida - My Bob there are no words that describe
  how much I love you. You have always been there for me like a dad and
  I can’t thank you enough. Thank you for all the chicken burgers,
  wheelchair rides, babysitting, and so much more. Know that I am always
  here for you cause you were always there for me. Love you. From Iylah - My Bob. I love you so much you were the
  best babysitter ever I miss seeing you every day and cuddling in the
  lobby with you. You always make me laugh and I wish I didn’t
  have to go to school so I could hang out with you more Thank you
  for always being there for me love you Thank you for reading, caring,
    helping, sharing and being part of Bob’s story! We also want to say
    that although we’re facing another crisis, we’re grateful for all
    the love and support - time and money - so far. As can be well imagined, Bob’s life has made dramatic shift. We
    are so proud of all our children, grandchildren, friends and family
    who have joined us in this ever changing journey, it has certainly
    been challenging and enlightening. We’re very grateful to our huge
    mixed bag of kids, brothers Kevin and Doug, their wives Carolyn and
    Sue, Aunt Carol, Uncle David,  Aunt Marni and Uncle John as well as
    friends that were available to visit, offering their loving support
    both emotionally and financially. The grandkids have especially been awesome! They’ve displayed
    loving curiosity while being very patient, never, ok rarely whining,
    complaining or acting out. Love you all tons and we are so blessed
    to have you all Skylar, Maddox, Linden, Mikhail, Giaan, Carson and
    our beautiful Laila.  To the eldest; Sky you display such absolute
    amazing character for a 16 yr old young man, how you help, play and
    patiently care for the young ones. Mikhail, your FaceTime and
    pictures from the other side of the world are heartwarmingly
    precious, we are grateful. All of the parents have done a fabulous
    job helping the ‘lil ones navigate this difficult time…. you have
    all done well considering the situation. The grandones don’t fully
    understand what’s happening although for the youngest ones, it’s the norm. I am especially grateful to my assistant/friend Deb for her
    constant reliability and devotion, and to her 3 amazing girls, who
    all refer to Bob as “their Bob”. Deb has been instrumental in
    allowing me to devote so much of my time to being there for Bob. DLL, as always thank you for your ear, heart and brilliant mind.
    Your calm, quiet presence and the solid support is a precious gift.
     Tom, thank you as well. BNG, thank you for always checking in and being there no matter
    how crazy busy you are. The unconditional love, goofy antics and
    support along with your generosity means everything. AJR, as always, eternally grateful for you, your kind heart,
    sharp legal mind, meals left outside the door, beautiful time
    consuming and thoughtfully created gifts. I also would like to especially thank who we lovingly and
    jokingly refer to as our 42-year-old teenager Jojo.  She constantly
    makes herself available to be with Bob if I’m not. She regularly
    does grocery runs and has become our garbage fairy (as she leaves
    she will grab our garbage hauling it to garbage room). Jojo will sit
    in his room visiting, easily chatting or in silence often doing her
    crafts as he rests, watches TV or sleeps.  Her gentle, loving,
    subdued inconspicuous concern and charming ways make his days pass
    easier. Sandy, your exquisitely blended oils created with love, prayers
    and healthy blessings continue to benefit Bob, thank you. I must also acknowledge the boys;  for hauling furniture around
    up and down the building organizing our condo to accommodate Bob’s
    wheel chair, medical equipment and years of packing boxes of
    dialysis solution, picking up the slack in all the lil constant
    things Bob used to do for me at work.  Grateful they all live so
    close by, able to help whenever I call or just randomly drop by. And
    to our Spring/Summer imported one, Leo you are always willing to
    help with a huge grin, thank you. A huge thank you to Courtney and Bey for gifting the indoor
    electric wheelchair, it’s made your Dad’s life so much easier.
     Although you both are very busy with careers and kids you make
    certain to keep in touch. Bey, we are forever grateful for the care,
    love and support you constantly demonstrate to us, especially Dad. Wayne, Jr., Gibran and Ale, you have been very generous with
    your loving support, time  and financial assistance these last
    years, we are grateful. To Brit, your regular upbeat and positive cheerful calls are
    heartwarming, we acknowledge that these last years have been
    extremely difficult for you. Adam we are grateful for your support
    and care in all that you do, especially the late night delivery of
    oxygen tanks. To both Dan and Bryan, thank you for sitting with him regularly
    while in the hospital giving me a break and allowing me to run home
    for a shower.  Bryan, Dan, Edgar and Jack you continue to be there,
    still making the effort to take Bob out getting together for a meal. WHY FUNDRAZR - DETAILS ON WHY BOB NEEDS HELP Bob receives CPP Disability of $1032 monthly. Together with
    Fitu’s income, there is a backwards slide every month and credit has
    been maxed out for a while. Our family Fundrazr campaign is to cover the areas listed
    below. Please consider donating; all funds raised will be held in a
    Trust Account set up by a lawyer who’s generously offering her time.
    All funds will be allocated towards Bob’s medical expenses, recovery
    and transitions to begin living his “new normal” life.  Any extra
    funds will be used for getting him some part time assistance as Fitu
    is working F/T and can’t always be with him. PROSTHETIC LEG - $4,000-$5,000 (balance of $10,000
    paid by Medical) Bob’s right foot and leg to the knee have already been
    amputated. Prosthetic leg costs are only partially covered. At this
    time, funds will only be used for the prosthetic for his right leg.
    We’re still in the process and will update when we know the exact
    amount that we’ll need. Fingers crossed that Bob will once again be
    able to golf, get out on the water again and work around the
    apartment tower. OUTDOOR ELECTRIC WHEELCHAIR - $5500 Bob will require an outdoor electric wheelchair. The one he has
    right now is very low power and not designed to go outside. It can’t
    make it up even a slight incline. Bob will have a lot more mobility
    and be able to get out and about, go grocery shopping and enjoy the
    spring with the grandkids. MOVING TO A WHEELCHAIR FRIENDLY APARTMENT - $2400 (Moving Expenses $1200 + Rent Increase $200x 6/mo = $1200). The suite we currently live in is not wheelchair friendly and
    Bob has extreme difficulty moving about. The doorways are very
    narrow, he’s unable to ride into bathroom as the door opens in, so
    he must leave it in the hallway and hop into the bathroom, so far
    he’s fallen three times trying to negotiate his way in. Our kitchen
    is difficult for Bob to use, whereas the new one will only have one
    long bank of cabinets and appliances, not a “U” shape. Bob has always been a great cook and the new kitchen will make
    it possible for him to make food safely. We will be moving two buildings away to the 4th tower.  We are
    limited as to where we can live because of my work as an onsite
    resident managing the building.  The same developer will have an
    accessible friendly suite ready for us. We will incur moving
    expenses along with a $200 monthly rent increase to what we
    currently pay but with the prognosis of extended rehab and the
    likelihood of another amputation we don’t have much of a choice. MEDICATION - $1100 x 6/ mo = $6600 Bob’s dialysis solution are covered by BC Medical. However, we
    pay cash for the diabetes and blood pressure medication. A new cost
    since March is Bob’s Chinese herbal medicines which are specifically
    for circulation for the leg. He’s noticed an improvement and the
    medicines will help keep the remaining leg and arms healthy so Bob
    can continue to live life to the fullest and do the things he loves
    like cooking for the family and playing with the kids. VAN THAT CAN TRANSPORT THE WHEELCHAIR  - $4320 Bob is in and out of the hospital. Plus there are a ton of
    doctors appointments. In November, we purchased a new van to
    transport Bob, wheelchair and dialysis equipment and supplies.
    Payments are $720/ month. $4320 of raised funds will cover 6 months
    and take a bit of financial pressure off. The journey to help Bob stabilize and live many more years
      is ongoing and we’re grateful to all of our family and friends
      who’ve been there and continue to be. BOB'S MEDICAL HISTORY 2012  July - Diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes and
    high blood pressure.  At this point all was blood work and symptoms were an indication that Bob was hopeful
    to control the symptoms with diet and medicine. 2013 Diabetes controlled with medications and diet adjustments as was
    blood pressure. Losing sensation in feet due to diabetic neuropathy, onset of
    almost constant nausea accompanied by lack of energy.  Back then I began rating his
    overall well-being as 3-4 good days followed by 1 bad day. 2014 Diagnosed with the beginning stages of kidney failure, altered
    diet yet again, this was a struggle to balance a diabetic friendly diet with the renal
    failure diet. i.e. nuts and cheese recommended for diabetics are not permitted for renal patients. 2015 Followed by his nephrologist, Kidney Clinic and
  several other health professionals - opthamologist,
    cardiologist, internal medicine, vascular surgeon etc. 2016 March Began daily Peritoneal Dialysis , 6
    cycles/exchanges per day.  Improved energy with blood work reflecting stabilizing symptoms with treatment. 2017 Peritoneal Dialysis treatment was causing other issues with
    peritoneal cavity and organs. Diagnosed with hernias caused by PD and the weight of
    2000 ml of solution constantly putting pressure on lining and supporting muscles. Oct - Began the process for preparing for a kidney
    transplant, unfortunately there were ongoing complications and
    increasing health issues compromising the viability of a transplant.
     As quickly as our medical system permitted we began addressing each
    concern only to constantly find another. The diabetes, although well
    controlled, was slowly and quietly but effectively destroying his
    eyes, weakening other organs, affecting the mind and circulation.
    Renal failure causes the destruction of soft muscle tissue, heart,
    liver, lungs etc. Liver function tests were showing that the enzymes
    are unhealthy, showing that there were cysts, scar tissue and the
    beginning of cirrhosis. Bob was told that he’ll eventually require a liver transplant as
    well but it should not interfere with a kidney transplant.  His
    heart has 50% blockage in the upper apex the surgeon will wait to
    insert stents when it is at 70% and appears to be fine aside from
    the high blood pressure. Since 2016 Bob has been closely followed by an Opthamologist,
    monthly he would see her, for scans, injections and laser treatments
    to increase eye health and vision.  She was successful, Bob’s vision
    is actually pretty good. The prognosis is also positive as for some
    time he was very fearful and worried that he’d be blind as well. Another prerequisite for Bob’s health to remain on the
    transplant list is that all of his dental work must be certified by
    a dentist so as not be a risk for future infection, advised that the
    most effective and absolute way to ensure that would be to have his
    remaining teeth extracted and be fitted for dentures. Fortunately
    with the financial help from Kevin and Carolyn, Bob was able to have
    this done in November 2018. One more step towards transplant, or as
    Bob would say, ""one hop at a time"" . 2018 Jan - at this point the side effects of peritoneal
    dialysis were debilitating and Bob remained bed ridden most of the times. Constant nausea and
    vomiting for 5 months requiring weekly trips to emergency for IVs to
    increase fluid in body, extreme weight and muscle mass loss. June - Hemodialysis treatment alleviated the nausea
    and seemed to overall increase Bob’s energy. July - Final stages of extensive transplant testing
    the Kidney Transplant team has determined that although I am a
    match, because Bob has received transfusions he now has antibodies
    that will not accept my kidney.  We are now included in a program
    called “Paired Donors” - this program matches a recipient and a
    donor with another set of participants across Canada, exchanging the
    available donor kidney. Aug - Tiny cut on right fourth toe eventually
    presented signs of gangrene, rounds of antibiotics were unsuccessful to cure infection. As the weeks
    and months passed without sufficient circulation to support the healing the entire toe was
    affected. Sept - During the 3 times weekly in hospital
    treatments of hemodialysis Bob regularly contracted infections and suffered with horrible stomach issues. At this point he chose to give PD another try.  Once he switched
    back to daily home administered peritoneal dialysis, stomach issues
    and infections no longer an issue.  Prognosis was to Insert stents
    to hopefully facilitate healing or at the very least to assist the
    healing of foot once toe was amputated. Oct 9 Admitted to RCH Angioplasty to insert stents in right leg to increase
    circulation to facilitate healing of toe October amputated toe Nov 6 amputated right leg below knee Now the rush is on to rearrange our condo, purchase all the
    required mobility equipment to begin our “new normal” lives. Nov 19 discharged from RCH - the healing process at
    home was slow but fortunately with being followed weekly by RCH’s
    awesome team at the Wound and Limb preservation clinic and his
    Vascular Surgeon Bob’s wound healed with only 2 infections. 2019 Left foot -  painful, extremely cold, no circulation discoloured
    red and no feeling in toes. Testing to determine blood flow and circulation - 50% of October
    2018 results March - amputation wound sufficiently healed to
    begin the process to be fitted for a prosthetic leg/foot which will
    cost $10-12,000.  On the wait list for rehab. March 4 - Chinese Dr. attended Bob at home to
    diagnose and try to help with lower leg and foot circulation to
    possibly save it from amputation.  Prescribed a twice daily dose of
    herbs. March 8 - Vascular Surgeon advises to wait and
    see, will eventually attempt to insert another stent as a last
    chance to postpone inevitable lower leg from amputation. March 23 - Wait list to begin training to perform
    home hemodialysis. April 2 - Continued positive results, less pain
    while continuing the Chinese Medicines. Thanks again for helping Bob!
    Please comment, spread the word and help him reach his Fundrazr
    goal, move to the new apartment and get his new leg. Everything
    helps and, Bob likes to say,  it's ""one hop at time!""",https://fundrazr.com/HelpSupportBob
"1,670",Please Help Us With Dad's Pancreatic Cancer Chemo Costs,Euro,,of €37k goal,47,"A few weeks ago, my father, Florin, was diagnosed with stage 3
  pancreatic cancer at the head of the pancreas. For those who don’t
  know us, I’m Laura, I have a sister and a brother who’s 11 years old,
  so still only a young kid who doesn’t fully understand what is
  happening with our father’s health. We are all desperate and worried
  and have started this fundraising campaign to ask for your help and
  kindness, to be able to cover our father’s chemo treatment costs. We
  can’t even imagine living in a world where our father is no longer
  there and even writing this down makes my hands shake. For us all, this terrible news has come as a shock, we couldn’t
  believe something like this could happen to him. I saw him first on
  the 13th of February after my last visit home in October, and I felt a
  knot in my throat. He had just had a stent inserted to help with the
  jaundice and the tall, imposing, well build man I’ve always known him
  to be was then skinny and grey skinned. Since then, he’s looking much
  better, gained back a healthier color in his cheeks, he’s got a
  healthy appetite and he’s feeling hopeful and determined to get better. At the moment, the tumor they found is a huge 45 millimeters
  adenocarcinoma and is not operable. Thankfully, a chemo treatment
  available in Vienna could improve his life chances, hopefully
  shrinking the tumor down, making it operable. Last week, doctors
  advised treatment should start immediately as there is no more time to
  waste and the healthcare standard available in Vienna is the best
  available option for my dad’s prognosis. On the 1st of March, he
  started his first round of chemo with Abraxane and Gemzar. Each chemo
  session is charged at 3700 euros and the cost is estimated at around
  37.000 euros for the first few months of treatment. Right now, we’re
  taking it step by step, though in the near future, under the
  circumstances, we do not know how we will be able to afford treatment
  anymore. It’ s widely known that pancreatic cancer is one of the most
  aggressive types, but if anyone can come back from this, I know it’s
  our dad. He has always been a strong, optimistic man and continues to
  be so even under the circumstances. He is willing to do and try
  everything possible to fight this, but we do need help to see him
  through. Please, as far as possible, help us get there! Any donations
  can help us get closer to saving dad. We will forever be thankful and
  grateful for your kindness! .......................................................................................................................... Cu câteva săptămâni în urmă, tatal nostru, Florin Mateescu, a fost
  diagnosticat cu cancer pancreatic, stadiul 3 la cap de pancreas.
  Pentru cei ce nu ne cunosc, sunt Laura, am o soră și un frate care are
  11 ani,  încă un copil, care nu înțelege pe deplin ce se întâmplă cu
  sănătatea tatălui nostru. Suntem cu toții disperați și îngrijorați și
  am început această campanie de strângere de fonduri pentru a cere
  ajutorul vostru și a face apel bunătatii voastre, sa putem acoperi
  costurile de tratament pentru tata. Nici nu ne putem închipui să trăim
  într-o lume în care el nu mai este și numai scriind aceste randuri,
  imi tremura mainile. Pentru noi toți, această veste teribilă a venit ca un șoc, nici acum
  nu putem crede că așa ceva i se putea întâmpla lui. Pe 13 Februarie,
  prima dată când l-am văzut pe tata de la ultima mea vizită in Romania
  din Octombrie, am simțit un nod în gât. Tocmai ce ii pusesera un stent
  pentru a controla icterul, arata slab, cu pielea de o culoare cenusie.
  De atunci, se simte mult mai bine, are din nou o culoare sănătoasă în
  obraji, un apetit sănătos și se simte plin de speranță și hotărât să
  faca tot posibilul sa se insanatoseasca. Tumoarea pe care au descoperit-o este un adenocarcinom de 45 de
  milimetri și care, deocamdata nu este operabil. Din fericire, un
  tratament cu chimioterapie disponibil în Viena ar putea să-i
  îmbunătățească șansele de viață, sperând că o sa scadă tumoarea,
  devenind operabila. Săptămâna trecută, medicii au recomandat ca
  tratamentul să înceapă imediat, nu mai este timp de pierdut, iar
  standardul medical disponibil în Viena este cea mai bună opțiune
  disponibilă pentru tratarea tatălui meu. La 1 Martie, a început prima
  rundă de chimioterapie cu Abraxane și Gemzar. Fiecare sesiune de
  chimioterapie costa 3700 de euro, iar costul este estimat la
  aproximativ 37.000 de euro pentru primele luni de tratament. In
  momentul de fata, o luăm pas cu pas, deși în viitorul apropiat, în
  aceste circumstanțe, nu știm cum vom putea să ne permitem continuarea tratamentului. Dupa cum se bine stie, cancerul pancreatic este unul din tipurile
  cele mai agresive, dar dacă cineva poate reusi in lupta asta, știu că
  acea persoana e tată. El a fost întotdeauna un om puternic, optimist
  și continuă să fie la fel chiar si în aceste momente. Este dispus să
  facă și să încerce tot posibilul pentru a lupta împotriva acestui
  cancer, dar avem nevoie de sprijinul vostru. Vă rugăm, pe cat posibil,
  să ne ajutati, orice donație ne poate aduce mai aproape de a il salva
  pe tata. Va vom fi pentru totdeauna recunoscători pentru bunătatea voastră!",https://fundrazr.com/c1TAWc
165,Help Jaxson get colorblind glasses,U.S. Dollar,,of $349 goal,7,"Help Jaxson See The World In Color! Jaxson will turn 8 in May of 2019.
      He is color blind. He has strong proton color blindness. This
      means that his red cones don't detect enough red and are too
      sensitive to greens, yellows and organs. As a result, greens,
      yellows, oranges, reds and browns appear the same especially in
      low light. He also has difficulty telling blues from purples and
      pinks from grays. Jaxson is a sweet kid and is well adapted to having color blindness
    but it does make somethings more difficult. You really take for
    granted how much you rely on seeing color. There are many common
    things that Jaxson struggles with: picking out clothes that match,
    finding the right color of LEGO while building a kit, seeing print
    on a colored background, and even seeing his bobber while fishing. I took him to try the color blind glasses out because he told me
    that he just wanted to see what the world was really like. He
    described seeing colors for the first times as amazing and
    mind-blowing! He told me that he saw colors that he never saw before
    like red, purple and pink. He told me that he doesn't want me to get him the glasses because
    he is okay with how God made him and he doesn't want me to spend
    that much money on him. I would like to get him these for his
    birthday so that he doesn't feel as if we are spending tons of money
    on him. His lenses will cost about $469. This is the cost with the frames.
    We are hoping that insurance maybe able to cover the frames.
    Insurance will not cover anything for the lenses. Please help us let Jaxson see the world in color! WHAT IS ENCHROMA? Over 300 million people worldwide are affected by red-green color
  vision deficiency, also called color blindness. Enchroma has created
  glasses which enhance color vision without the compromise of color
  accuracy. Enchroma glasses are an optical assistive device; they are not
      a cure for color blindness. Results vary depending on the type and
      extent of color vision deficiency per individual. The glasses are
      estimated to be effective for 4 out of 5 cases (80%) of red-green
      color vision deficiency – prospective users are encouraged to take
      our online color vision test to assess the likelihood of efficacy. Enchroma does not
      endorse use of the glasses to pass occupational screening tests
      such as the Ishihara test. For more information please read the FAQs , learn about the Enchroma technology and story , or contact customer support . Check out these reactions",https://fundrazr.com/01UhUc
"5,270",Kidney for Bryanna,U.S. Dollar,"Jul 1, 2019",of $5k goal,52,"My daughter, Bryanna, needs a kidney. She is 19 years old and is one
  of the hardest working, loving and hilarious young Christian woman I
  have known. Unfortunately, while she was a junior in high school, it
  was discovered that her kidneys were failing. She was diagnosed with FSGS, which causes scarring in the tiny
  filters in her kidneys, rendering them useless. Several medications
  were used in an attempt to slow the progress of the disease but her
  body did not respond.  This past November she had a dialysis catheter
  placed and started dialysis. She does her dialysis at home and has so
  much responsibility between her daily 14 hour dialysis routine, many
  medications, strict diet and weekly clinic appointments. As her health
  declined, she has maintained a part time job and has taken classes at
  community college as she wants to become a registered nurse. She has
  nowhere near the stamina a 19 year old should have but she pushes
  herself so hard. Wait time for a type O kidney in Michigan is 5-5 1/2 years. As a
  parent it is gut wrenching to watch her suffer the fatigue, constant
  nausea, and occasional depression. A suitable live donor has not been
  found. Fort Worth, Texas currently has the shortest wait time in the
  nation at less than a year is estimated. As a result, we are uprooting
  our family and moving to Texas in order to have her listed there. We will be starting over with new insurance deductibles and, due to
  moving expenses, paying her medical costs will be very difficult.
  Please consider donating in order to offset the medical costs for her
  current treatment and help us prepare for a transplant. All donations
  will be kept in a separate account for her medical bills. Ability to
  afford medical expenses (such as post transplant anti-rejection
  medications) is necessary in order to be listed for transplant. We appreciate all support, whether it is monetary, a prayer or a word
  of encouragement. Please be sure to consider becoming a registered
  organ donor and be sure your family is aware of your wishes. There are
  so many people like Bryanna who are waiting. Thank you so much for reading this and for caring.",https://fundrazr.com/11Ugn5
"32,749",Hannah's Heroes,U.S. Dollar,,of $177k goal,586,"Our daughter Hannah was born with 2 very rare diseases 1 called C.A.H
  and the other called Spinal Muscular Atrophy, which works to rob her
  of her ability to move, breath and, eventually, live. There is a drug
  that can stop this disease. It has just approved it. But accessing it
  costs $177,000, and the process of our drug plan won’t be ready for
  another year. That’s a year that our little girl can’t afford to wait.
  It would be a year of vulnerability and loss. But with your
  help, we believe we can turn it into a year of miracles! Let me
  tell you the rest of our story. Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) has
  become our daily life. It’s the genetic condition most likely to kill
  children under six years of age, and our daughter has it. It’s a
  progressive lower motor neuron disease, that is loosely paralleled to
  adult ALS. But there are significant differences: most notably, SMA
  never affects cognition, so our daughter is as bright and keen as any
  other child her age. At 14 months, Hannah took her first 3 steps. She has never walked
  since then. After those first steps, she lost any strength to walk,
  then strength to pull up to stand, and then the strength to crawl. She
  can barely get from a lying position to a sitting position. Hannah is
  our mature little scholar! But she is completely dependant on us for
  dressing, toileting, and getting her in her wheelchair.But those
  things aren’t the worst. She is at an extreme risk of respiratory
  failure. Every single simple cold/viral infection is a threat. At
  least three times a year these infections strike hard enough to send
  her to the hospital. As a parent, I weep and get nauseous just
  thinking about this. I don’t want to think about what the next year
  could hold for her. But the amazing thing is that it doesn’t have
  to be that kind of year for our little girl. For over two decades
  the gene responsible for SMA has been known but there has not been a
  single available treatment. This past summer the first drug in history
  to specifically treat SMA was approved ! It is called Spinraza
  (Nusinersen). It can completely halt SMA in its path and even lead to
  some GAIN in muscle strength! This drug truly is a miracle, and
  we need our daughter on it as soon as possible. Though it’s
  approved Spinraza won’t be available on our drug plans for another
  year. It costs $177,000 to provide a year’s supply for Hannah 3 vials
  . The manufacturer, Biogen, will sell it directly to families willing
  to pay for it. This treatment WILL stop Hannah's respiratory deterioration, keep her
  hands strong, and prevent future problems in her spine that would
  require surgery.And we don’t even know what gains it might provide.
  Instead of a year of atrophy it can become a year of miracles! But we
  need your help. We do everything we can for our little girl but we
  can’t do this alone. We need to raise $177,000. Please join us
  on our journey and help to make this a year of miracles for Hannah",https://fundrazr.com/HannahsHeroes
355,Help James get something off their chest!,U.S. Dollar,,of $8k goal,10,"About me: I’m a passionate animal lover from Roanoke,
  VA working at a nonprofit animal welfare organization in the
  Shenandoah Valley (yep, the same one the sad song is about). I was
  privileged as a young adult to spend time in safe spaces, and I found
  the latitude to question my gender. While I was described as a tomboy
  in my childhood, there is perhaps more to the story as an adult. The Challenge: I am deeply rooted to nonprofits and
  cause-based work, leaving little time and energy left towards pure
  capital gain. That said, over my years of questioning, researching,
  listening to trans people’s personal journeys, and amplifying voices
  where and when I can, surgery is going to be part of my transition to
  greater comfort in my own body and my own skin. While I find it
  difficult to put into language the nuance of how I feel in my body,
  the long and short of it is that I’m very uncomfortable with some of
  its features that cannot be the shape I feel they should without top surgery. The Goal: The purpose of this fundraiser is to raise
  money to pay for my top surgery. Donations will go directly to getting
  something off my chest so I can continue my work in the nonprofit
  sector with animals who have no voice otherwise. I humbly ask for your consideration among
  so many other worthy causes. A few dollars, a few cents, is deeply
  appreciated! Every contribution counts! No donation is too small!",https://fundrazr.com/boobsbegone
"690,181",British Gut,,,,,"This is a unique open collaboration between the TwinsUK team at King's College London and The American Gut Project (AGP) / The Microsetta Initiative to expand the study of the bacterial diversity to
    participants in Europe. If you are a participant living outside Europe and would like
    to participate, please refer to our American Gut Fundrazr page . Many
  people don't realize that the bacteria that live inside us play an
  incredibly important role in our health. There are so many of them:
  They make up 50 percent of the cells in our body and their most
  important jobs include manufacturing vitamins for us and breaking down
  and digesting our food. The trillions of bacteria in our gut weigh
  nearly 2 kg (over 4lbs). This community of bacteria can be thought of
  as an extra 'organ' which we call our ""microbiome"".  Recent
  research has discovered that small changes in this finely balanced
  community can affect our immune system, metabolism, body weight, mood
  and may even cause diseases such as Crohn's disease, irritable bowel
  syndrome, cancer, autoimmune disease, diabetes and heart disease. This is the first project of its kind in Europe, as an extension
    of the American Gut Project & The Microsetta Initiative, based
    at the University of California San Diego.  We have collaborated
    with TwinsUK at King’s College London so that those living in Europe
    can participate, and with your help, we will be able to discover
    more about the crucial relationship between our health and our
    microbiome, and on a personal level, you will be able to discover
    the bacterial profile of your own gut. With your help, we hope to be
    able to answer questions such as 'How much does our choice of
    lifestyle and diet influence our microbiome, and can we alter our
    microbiome to make us healthier?' We are discovering that each person is very different and has
    their own unique microbiome. More research is needed to work out
    what constitutes a 'healthy' microbiome, and which combinations of
    bacteria are beneficial and which ones should be avoided. In order
    to do this ambitious and much-needed project, we urgently need a
    large scale collection of human samples. Over ten thousand people
    have already signed up in America already through the American Gut
    Project-- but we need many more from Europe. The project mainly focuses on the gut as this is our main
    'microbial home', however, the study will also look at areas like
    the oral and skin, as these areas of the body may be influenced by
    the microbiome. Joining is simple! Select the kit you would like from the list
    of options on the left-hand side by clicking “Claim this perk” found
    on the right side (if you would like to receive a specific number of
    kits that isn’t listed as a perk, email us at info@britishgut.org ). You will receive your kit within 3 weeks after payment. Shipping within the U.K. first class should be around £2.90, but
    we recommend taking the sample to the post office to get the proper
    postage. Getting the postage right on the first try is important
    since samples that spend a long time in transit will likely not
    produce the highest quality results. After you have returned your
    sample to us, we will then sent it to the Knight Lab at the
    University of California San Diego to be processed and analyzed. We estimate that the whole process will take about 4-5
  months. We typically bulk ship samples back to the Knight
  Lab every 1-2 months on dry ice to reduce shipping costs. Once your
  sample is arrives at the Knight Lab (you'll get a notification when

"1,832",Help Us Make Ireland's Dream a Reality!,U.S. Dollar,,of $500k goal,26,"Hello, we are Megan and Mark. Over three years ago Megan gave birth
  to our beautiful baby girl, Ireland. However, during birth, an
  umbilical cord prolapse resulted in Ireland having cererbal palsy. She
  spent the first 7 weeks of life in the hospital, and we waitied
  anxiously to take her home to her older brothers. This was our first real world experience with cerebral palsy. Many
  people we talk to today don't even know what cerebral palsy is.
  Cerebral palsy is a variable type of brain injury that affects people
  in many different ways. Some children are only slightly affected,
  while others are permamently disabled, wheelchair-bound, and need
  constant attendant care. Cerebral palsy makes a huge impact on the family dynamic. Not only
  are many cerebral palsy families financially dessimated by this
  disease, but they are also stressed emotionally and physically. There are no treatments out there that are covered by insurance to
  treat or reverse cererbal palsy. However, there are many, many
  therapies available worldwide that improve cerebral palsy, and can
  have significant impacts on quality of life. Unfortunately, most of
  these therapies are difficult to obtain due to lack of insurance
  coverage and travel costs. We were lucky enough to discover and utilize many of these therapies
  for Ireland, and have seen dramatic improvements in her since using
  these therapies. We truly believe that no child with cerebral palsy
  should have his or her treatment options limited by his or her
  parent's financial status. Out of this belief, Ireland's Dream was born. Ireland's Dream is to establish a medical center that is fully
  dedicated to the treatment of people with cerebral palsy and their
  families. This Center will have the latest in treatment technologies
  that people all over the world are using for cerebral palsy, available
  under one roof. These therapies include hyperbaric oxygen, ozone
  therapy, Cuevas Medek therapy, scoliosis treatment, and vibration
  therapy. Other necessary therapies will include family counseling,
  diet/nutritional interventions, feeding therapy, assistive device
  training, and more. Our goal is to make cerebral palsy synonymous with Ireland's Dream.
  Please help us make Ireland's Dream come true for patients all over
  the country who are suffering from the debilitating disease. We thank you greatly for any support you can provide.",https://fundrazr.com/f13EF1

I'm first and foremost human who deserves happiness, like we all do :) Please help me in achieving a life awaited dream of mine. I've been on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for nearly two years
  now. Had a bilateral Orchiectomy in August 2014. Although I've been
  transitioning ever since I was 19 with the knowledge Iam transgender
  from a very young age. Since 2011 till present;  I have undergone more
  than just physical and emotional changes.  I had/have to attend
  numerous physiologist,  psychiatrist, endocrinologist, GP and many
  other specialist appointments, tests/examinations and blood tests.
  Along the side had and continue to put up with the financial and
  emotional stress, and burden from society and my family. I moved out to be independent in May 2014.  Since then more drama had
  developed.  Adding to the financial pain. All my appointments, tests,
  medicine and travel is very costly and adds to the hole in my pocket.
   Day after day i deal with a lot, just to get by without going crazy.
   I have lost a job over who i am and been refused many since then.
  Being transgender isn't easy, but it's who I am and I will do anything
  in my power to be a full female; or die trying.  Unfortunately the
  Australian Government doesn't cover my surgery.  I need this surgery
  to live.  In order to function and enjoy being a full female,  SRS is
  mentally,  physically and emotionally necessary. If you could help
  make this dream, a reality that would be the most appropriated. Love cooking, baking, fashion, sewing, travel, animals, movies,
  music, winter, tea and health. Thank you!",https://fundrazr.com/dwIO5

975,Lena's journey to become a Professional Sexological Bodyworker,Euro,,of €3k goal,6,"I need your support to take part at the Sexological Bodywork
    Professional Training in Berlin Welcome to my fundraising campaign. I need your help to pay for my six months training at the Institute
  of Somatic Sexology to become a somatic sex educator. http://sexological-bodywork.institute/ Who am I? I am questioning things. I am curious, I am aware of the fact
  that there is more then one truth, more then one way of living a life. My eating disorders brought me into studying nutrition, and
  afterwards into becoming a chef in order to confront and step by step
  to heal myself. Miscommunication and a lack of loving touch in my
  family also took me on this journey. My trauma was drawing important
  steps in my life so far. Now, I developed a understanding that working with my wound/
  with my trauma is a life long journey. I see the importance of working
  with and raising life energy. Our strongest life energy is our sexual
  energy. Within every journey has to travel through sexuality. I feel I
  need to support and heal other beings, especially women. I am able to
  meet them where they are. I understand, because I am travelling the
  same journey. In my opinion there is a connection in between our eating and
  sexual behaviour, I would like to learn and to research deeper
  regarding this interaction. What is a sexual somatic bodyworker? A Certified Sexological Bodyworker educates and empowers people
  who are interested in their own erotic development. By using breath,
  voice, movement, touch and massage, a professional sexual bodyworker
  is providing a journey for people to find out more about their bodies,
  sex and sexuality, or work through sexual issues or concerns. My goals with the course: • Being able to create and hold a safe space for people who are
  on their journey of experiencing themselves by travelling through
  their sexuality • Receive a professional education in ways to
  touch individual people in a healing way • Being empowered to
  share my opinion that sexuality should be free of guilt and shame and
  to educate the next generation about healthy and stigma-free sexuality • Combining spiritual work like Yoga, Meditation, Pranayama,
  Reiki healing, Estatic dance with knowledge and further research about
  how to nourish our bodies on a celluar basis through food and sexuality To take part at this life changing experience I need your
    financial support. It is an investigation into myself – that is truth- but longterm it is an investment in something bigger, deeper. It
  is core work. Working on your real core, finding your truth, inner
  self and also working at the core of life which is our sexual energy.
  Finding ways for people to communicate and live sexuality with
  awareness, presence and authenticity. Program of the training: Module One Online Group Study: May 3 to June 28,
  2019 Module Two Embodiment Intensive: July 1 to July 13,
  2019 Module Three Supervised Practice: July 19 to October 31,

  over 100 € via a 60 minutes session of Reiki healing. I am a cerified
  reiki healer, and I deeply love this energy work. If there is no
  opportunity to meet I am offering a skype/zoom consultation after my
  graduation in August. ""Great is the matter of birth and death. Life slips quickly by. Time waits for no one. Wake up. Wake up. Don’t waist a moment."" I feel it is the right time to do this training. This is why I

"1,846,245",American Gut,,,,,"The Human Microbiome Project and other microbiome projects
    worldwide have laid an important foundation for understanding the
    trillions of microbes that inhabit our bodies and their impact on
    health and disease. However, opportunities for the public to get
    involved in such research have been limited. Now, American Gut gives
    you an opportunity to join this research project and learn what’s
    living on and inside you. American Gut is a project built on the open-source, open-access
    principles of the Earth Microbiome Project. The data we collect is
    de-identified and then deposited into open repositories for the
    benefit of other researchers and scientists.  By participating in
    our project, you can help contribute to research that will help the
    world understand how the microbiome affects our health. In exchange
    for your participation, we generate a report summarizing the types
    of microbes observed in your sample, and how your sample relates to
    other people in the study. While American Gut mainly focuses on the gut as this is where
    most of our microbes reside, we will also look at areas like the
    oral and skin, as these areas of the body also contain microorganisms. The American Gut Project is a part of the Microsetta Initiative , with
    the goal of collecting microbiome samples and rich phenotypic data
    from populations across the globe. Some examples of what we have found using our data: Younger
  children tend to have more proteobacteria composing their microbiome.
   As you grow older, the diversity of your microbiome increases. (Based off our preliminary findings in 2014,
      found here ) There’s a significant difference between the types of bacteria
    found in industrialized populations vs. non-industrialized populations. McDonald et al. mSystems . May 2018. DOI: 10.1128/mSystems.00031-18 If You Live in the U.S.: Joining is
    simple! Select the kit you would like from the list of options on
    the right-hand side by clicking “Claim this perk” (if you would like
    to receive a certain number of kits that isn’t listed as a perk,
    email us at info@americangut.org ) . Your kit
    will arrive via USPS within 2 weeks after payment, unless you have added the “Priority Shipping”
    perk along with your kit. If You Live in Europe: Visit our sister site, British Gut , to join. If You Live in Australia or Singapore: While we do have sites set up in Australia and Singapore (known
    as Australian Gut and Asian Gut respectively), we ask that participants contribute an additional $25 on top
    of their contribution, which covers an international shipping fee . These sites allow participants to send their samples back to a
    local site, which then sends the samples back to our lab in the U.S.
    to reduce the costs of shipping. If you live in Australia or Singapore and would like to
    participate, claim a perk.  The next page will have an option to
    ""top off"" your contribution with an additional amount,
    which you will use to add in the $25 to mark your kit to go out. I f you do not include the $25 shipping fee, your kit will not be
      sent out until we have received it. Once we have received your transaction, we will forward your
    information to our collaborators. They will then send out a kit to
    you, which you will receive within 3 weeks . Please note that the r eturn time for results will take significantly longer than the
    expected 3 months for Australian/Asian Gut participants. The reason
    is that we have to bulk ship samples on dry ice back to our lab at
    UC San Diego.  This costs thousands of dollars per shipment, so it’s
    only feasible to do once enough samples are ready to ship. If You Live Anywhere
    Else: International participants are also
    welcome to join. The $25 international shipping fee also applies (which you must include in your contribution), along with other regulations . I f you do not include the $25 shipping fee, your kit will not
      be sent out until we have received it. We also ask that samples are shipped back to our lab within 48 hours of being collected. The cost of shipping to our lab in the U.S. from some
    locations can be expensive , so it is recommended that you look into the cost of return
    shipping (it is highly suggested to use FedEx as it is more
    reliable). If you are interested in learning the process of our project
    from start to finish, we have a video available here . Each kit contains a sample tube (or more, if ordered), an
    instruction manual on how to register your kit and take a sample,
    credentials to access our participant website, and return
    envelope(s) to send your sample back. Your results will provide a general overview of how your microbial profile
    compares to other participants ( these results are not intended to be medically actionable,
      and we cannot provide any personalized interpretation ). You will also receive a list of the microorganisms found in
    your sample and their relative abundances (based at the genus
    level).  Results are uploaded via our participant website, which you
    will get access to once you register your kit. For stool samples, it will take about 3-4 months for you to receive your results, and longer for those who are
      participating outside the U.S. (due to shipping procedures to send
      samples back to our lab, which is based at the University of
      California San Diego).  It takes approximately significantly

"2,585",MAY the 4TH  be with you Michael Bacon !,Canadian Dollar,,of $5.5k goal,25,"APPEAL FROM SUZIE McNEIL It was in December that my good friend and manager Michael Bacon
  injured his right leg with partially torn quad tendons and his left
  leg with a small ankle fracture and a strained Achilles heel. With injuries to both of his legs simultaneously he was rendered
  unable to walk and admitted to Trillium Hospital on December 23 where
  he spent the Christmas holidays with close friends and family visiting. After spending over 28 days in the hospital for pain management,
  Michael was transferred to a long term care facility, commonly known
  as nursing homes, for Restorative Rehabilitation at the Cooksville
  Care Centre across the street from the hospital. Michael found it funny that his mother is 83 years old, has had a
  walker for years, had her knee replaced almost 2 years ago, both
  cataracts just operated on, and he beat her to a nursing home! Michael spent the last 3 months at the facility recovering and
  restoring his strength through ongoing daily physiotherapy.  He now
  can walk with the assistance of a walker and has just been released to
  return home to continue his recovery. I visited Michael at both the hospital and the nursing home and saw
  how difficult it was to see him confined to a hospital bed and only a
  wheelchair to get around for months, so seeing him walk with a walker
  is encouraging and I know he will fully recover. Unfortunately, being incapacitated for 4 months has put a toll on his
  finances as it would anyone not being able to work and having to put
  his business on hold.  On top of the loss of income is the expenses of
  the drugs, crutches, braces, boot cast, wheelchair, walkers, and
  ongoing physiotherapy which have added up considerably. As friends and family know Michael is always the first to offer his
  help when someone is in need, and has helped many musicians, friends
  and audiences enjoy live music together over the last 20 years in the
  music business. So to thank Michael for all of his hard work and generosity I decided
  to rally some support so I put together this FundRazr account and will
  host a fundraiser concert with many of the musicians Michael has
  worked with over the past 20 years.  Everyone was excited to be a part
  of it and we have an exceptional lineup of great musicians who are
  donating their time and talent to this great event. May the 4th be with you Michael Bacon! Featuring Suzie McNeil – Stacey Kay - Gord Deppe & Sandy Horne from
    the Spoons Jordan John – Tyler Yarema - Tom Barlow - Gracie Chuck Keeping – Peter Kadar and many more surprise guests! Saturday, May the 4th 4:00 -8:00 pm Shore Grill & Grotto 71 Lakeshore Rd E. Mississauga, ON It’s going to be one hell of a show and tickets are only $20 and will
  go fast so get them while you can. For advance sales, email the number of tickets required to maythe4thbewithyoumb@gmail.com For those who are unable to make it the fundraiser
  concert, we encourage you to contribute what you can to this

Help him hear again.",U.S. Dollar,"Jul 19, 2019",of $7.5k goal,5,"During my childhood at the age of 7, while most children run around,
  have fun with their friends, joyfully shouting and playing. I
  lost my hearing on my left ear. I was told by my mother, during my infancy, I had a high fever which
  led to my loss of hearing. Because I was too young, it was hard for me to notice that I had lost
  one of my hearing. One night, my mother asked me to call my grandpa. I used my right ear
  to make the call. After making the call. I asked my mother. “Ma, how come people can use only one ear?” And she responded me “People use 2 ears dear.” She was surprised, that I asked such question, and asked me why I
  asked that question. And I told her, “I can hear with only one ear ma.” That’s when my mom first noticed that I couldn’t hear with my left
  ear, and I learned that God gave me two ears but can hear with only one. This was one of the heartbreaking times I had to go through, but I
  tried to stay positive and be thankful that I can hear with the other ear. Both my parents worked so hard to help me get hearing aids, but it
  wasn’t easy because it costed too much. It wasn’t easy for me but I
  bet it was more difficult for my parents because seeing me and taking
  few years to realize that I had this disability. Just like what every parent would do, my mother brought be to the doctor. The doctor recommended my mom to get me hearing aids. Because I was
  young, I didn’t know how this would affect my hearing later on. At
  first, I didn’t want to admit and get hearing aids because I didn’t
  want others to make fun of me at school, or how people would see me. Many years passed and I was attending college that time. It was during my 3rd semester in college. It was a normal day and I was attending class. I always had
  difficulty understanding the lessons because I couldn’t hear the
  lectures clearly from afar, so I thought I was just in a bad condition
  because my hearing was worse on that day. I went back and slept in early that day. On the next day, that
  was the day. That was the day I’ve completely lost my hearing. I thought everything was just quiet and I woke up to early. It
  wasn’t. I lost both of my hearing on that day. Only God knew what I felt that time. Most of my close friends knew that I have a hearing problem, but they
  didn’t knew that it was getting worse. Because, I had to continue my studies. I had to shrug everything off
  and continue attending class. It was very difficult for me, but my friends were there to comfort me
  and support me. Despite their support and comfort, I wanted to give up because I
  still had 2 semesters left, and it was all too overwhelming for me. I couldn’t hear anything the lecturer was talking about during class. In frustration, on that evening, I was alone in my room, and in the
  dark, I cried in the dark alone. I pushed everyone away from me because it was too hard for me to
  accept everything and place my friends in difficult situations, I
  didn’t want to make it hard for them. Few days have passed and it was getting more difficult for me, so I
  had to call my parents. I’m originally from Sibu but was studying in Kuching. I called them,
  but I couldn’t hear anything, I tried so hard to hear and raise the
  loudspeaker volume to the max. I could only hear little sounds but I knew my mom was crying, we all
  cried that night. My mom prayed really hard and tried to support me
  the best that she can. Seeing my mom working so hard to support me gave me the strength. I tried to think positive. During class, I wrote down all my
  notes by copying notes from my classmates. I read everyday and studied as much as I could. Imagine studying with both of your ear closed. It was one of the most
  hardest part of my life. I studied really hard and surprisingly passed all my courses for that semester. My mom worked really hard and saved up enough to get me basic hearing
  aid. Since the hearing aid was too expensive my mom could only afford
  to buy me one piece of hearing aid for my right ear. On my 4th semester, that’s when I started hearing again. Though it
  was only my right ear, I was so thankful that I could hear little by
  little again. I finished my associate degree and now I’m working as a contractual
  employee, I try hard to work but because of my hearing, It was hard
  for me to find a job and people to take me in. I went to the hospital to check my hearing progress and the doctor
  told me, my hearing has deteriorated and I need to get a better one,
  because we could only afford the basic hearing aid. I try to work as hard as I could for the present and for the future
  but sometimes, my efforts are not enough because capabilities are
  limits because of my hearing. My mother worked so hard to help me get this basic hearing aids, but
  our family is on a tight budget to pay off the dues, my sisters
  education fees and living expenses. This is my last hope, please help me hear again. The hearing aid’s costs 7500usd, but this is a huge amount of money
  for our family though we work hard, it would take us years to pay off
  this amount. This is my last wish. I want to hear again so, I can work better and
  support my family. Both my parents are old and still working to
  support us and pay off the dues. Your help would be highly appreciated no matter what amount it would be. Thank you for spending your precious time to read my story.",https://fundrazr.com/71UYk9
140,Help Mel's Road to Recovery,U.S. Dollar,"Nov 30, 2019",of $18k goal,3,"My name is Melanie and THANK YOU for visiting my page! I am raising
  money to alleviate a portion of the financial stress that comes with
  having thousands of dollars worth of medical debt as a college student. In 2015, I was diagnosed with an eating disorder which has been with
  me since 2008. Eating disorders affect over 30 million people in the
  United States, and after a long period of denial, I recognize that I
  am one of those people, and that my life is at stake if I continue.
  Starting with the diagnosis in 2015, I have begun to seek recovery. Unfortunately, my first stay in residential treatment was not as
  effective as I'd hoped, in part because it was cut short due to
  financial stress and lack of adequate insurance coverage. Though there
  have been periods of decreased symptom-use while seeing an outpatient
  therapist, my health has continued to decline as symptoms have
  continued, especially with new stresses being introduced without the
  tools to manage depression and anxiety symptoms. This time around, things are vastly different. I've grown a lot, been able to keep a job as a Nurse's Aid where I
  love taking care of the elders and bonding with them. However, I've
  had to step away from that for the time being in order to give
  recovery a real chance, so that I can not only be out of the woods
  medically, but move on to the rest of my life as a healthy individual
  with a healthy relationship with others, starting with myself. As of Monday, June 10th, I will be admitted to Magnolia Creek's
  residential program just outside Birmingham, Alabama.  I know that I
  need this level of care to get myself to a healthy place, whatever the
  cost. However, it is not a cheap decision. Any help whether in prayers
  or in finances would be graciously received. I've been blessed with amazing, encouraging friends and coworkers as
  well as an adorable, faithful dog. If you would consider even giving a
  small contribution to this cause, my appreciation would be
  unfathomable, and you would quite literally be my hero. I thank you in
  advance for your kindness and generosity, and may God bless.",https://fundrazr.com/melsroadtorecovery

"8,988",Zach Branson's Medical Fundraiser,U.S. Dollar,"Jan 2, 2020",of $50k goal,72,"Zachary Branson was born with a liver disease known as biliary
  atresia. The main procedure that was performed is known as a Kasai
  portoenterostomy. This operation connects the bile drainage from the
  liver directly to the intestinal tract. Success of this procedure may
  be improved when it is done before an infant is 8 weeks old. The Kasai
  procedure is helpful because it permits bile to flow and can allow a
  child to grow and remain in fairly good health for many years. It is
  important to understand that this surgery is typically a treatment for
  and not cure of biliary atresia. Ongoing liver disease is likely to
  continue to occur even with a successful operation. Up to 80 percent
  of children who undergo the Kasai portoenterostomy will eventually
  need to have a liver transplant. Doctors warned that Zach would not
  live past the age of 2 years old. Now at 30 years old, Zach has
  surprised the medical community. He has gone through quite rough times
  in his life growing up with this disease. His mother passed away in
  2006 from liver and kidney failure due to alcoholism. Zach cannot work
  a ""normal"" job anymore due to complications that arise from
  this disease. He is currently in the process of fighting for
  disability. The application status is pending. We are asking to share
  this page with everyone you know. Encourage your loved ones and
  friends to become an organ and tissue donor. If you have been blessed
  enough in life to allow yourself to make a donation to this brave,

  our medical expenses incurred so far (+/-9,500,-US $) as well the cost

  find another rental moving to a better location with option to work

  down and in the blog we have started. Basically we are not capable on our own power to leave the

  circumstances that prior used crowdfund Youcaring merged with GoFundMe

  weeks here on our blog . The prior campaign did not generate any support since put online June
  2017 until Maria and a local good Samaritan, Francisco Lopez, reached
  out at the Baja Nomads forum and made the
  situation known at the beginning of May 2018. Them folks made already
  a HUGE impact on our life. Having everyday ""real"" food
  (prior eating for weeks beans & rice or Marushan), all medical
  supplies required and having made some payments to most pressing debt
  collectors, have electricity and communication secured. All this is
  already a big relieve creating some breathing space. Also here
  you find the progress in several sets of images from December 2016 on
  until August 2017 when we had to see phone with camera used. Please be
  aware - some of this images are VERY graphical and not for everybody's
  stomach to view!!! Album - Gallery until August 2017 here on Google documents . We have genuinely tried during the past 18 month to progress yet the
  combination of advancing the healing with ambulant treatment (the
  first 6 month 2-3x per week hospital visits), the cost of medication,
  medical supplies and transportation, basic cost of living - rent,
  electricity, telefon, food was in dimensions to large to cope for us.

  a clerical position in a hotel working night-shifts. We have sold any valuables to create funds, we have no vehicle. Ernst

"1,268",Bone Tumor Awareness Fund,U.S. Dollar,,of $5k goal,29,"Hello family, friends, and supporters!  I am a 33-year old survivor
  of an extremely rare bone tumor (desmoplastic fibroma), and have
  decided to embark on a journey to create more awareness and provide
  funding for more research for these rare tumors to help physicians and
  patients better understand these conditions, procedures, and treatment/recovery. I am currently recovering after undergoing a more aggressive/radical
  treatment after a 2nd recurrence of this tumor (in my right femur, as
  pictured) to replace my knee as well as half of the femur - the
  typical treatment for malignant osteasarcoma (my 5th operation in
  total).  This is pretty much a testament to how aggressive and
  grueling these tumors are, whether they are benign or not - that the
  treatment is similar or can be identical to that of a cancerous growth
  of the bone. These tumors happen in the 2nd and 3rd decades of life; therefore,
  the majority of individuals enduring this pain, multiple operations,
  and lengthy recoveries are in their childhood, teens, 20's and 30's.
   These are ages that are supposed to be the most active, fun, and
  joyful for youngsters and able-bodied people to be exercising, playing
  sports, etc.  Surgeries can be extremely invasive, painful, and
  continual. My goal is to create more awareness of these tumors that are vary
  rare (they make up approximately 2% of all tumors) and there are only
  about 120-200 orthopedic oncologists in the United States able to
  treat these rare growths.  Not to mention, in major cities and
  teaching institutions, rather than equally spread throughout - making
  it difficult for some patients to travel to see exactly who they need
  to see. I'd like to be able to create a community where survivors of
  these tumors can share their experiences with one another and provide
  support, as well as to start a fund that will benefit research toward
  a particular body of medical science that will be dedicated to
  learning more about muskuloskeletal lesions/tumors. For more information about bone tumors, please visit www.bonetumor.org . EVERY dollar counts.  Many
  perks are available to select with a donation. PLEASE like us on Facebook, www.facebook.com/bonetumorawareness, and/or

    let go, connect, renew and reflect.  Thousands upon thousands of
    people walk and sit either alone or with their closest friends as
    they leave hand-scribed messages, photographs, poems and deeply
    connected personal items behind. The Temple holds this honor for all
    to mourn, grieve, and even celebrate significant milestones in their lives. The Temple of Direction is designed by Geordie Van Der Bosch,  a
    San Francisco based Architect. His vision for a temple is a linear
    interior with two main entrances. Each entrance leads through a
    tunnel to the main hall. Dense wall space creates ample surface for
    temple visitors to leave messages and place items. If the man is the heart of Burning Man, the Temple is it’s soul.
    The tradition of the temple is one of love and honor. The role of
    Temple Builder is a sacred post that Geordie has accepted with equal
    parts grace and glee. The logistics behind the Temple of Direction are considerable.
    Construction will begin in San Francisco, transition to Reno and end
    on the Playa. Our fundraising goals are ambitious.  Your financial
    contribution will bring the temple to the residents of Black Rock
    City and we thank you. The Temple is supported in part by a grant from Burning Man. The rest
  is up to us: the volunteer crew and the entire community. This
  campaign is dedicated to pay for the costs lumber, steel bolts and
  fasteners, transportation of materials, and much needed tools to
  safely and accurately construct this solemn space. In addition, a
  portion of this fundraiser is earmarked for infrastructure during the
  month-long build in August on the playa. The Temple of Direction will be co-creating with the following collaborators. The Koi Pond The Koi Pond is a large-scale interactive light sculpture that

"20,313",The Final Push - Stop Brexit with Steve Bray and SODEM,Pound Sterling,,of £50k goal,699,"We need to ask for your help again. And sorry that help is financial.
  This really is the final push and how effective we can be is entirely
  down to how much money we can raise. In January Steve and the team were able to move into Airbnb
  accommodation in the heart of Westminster for 4 nights a week (thanks
  to your generous donations). As well as giving the team a base, this
  also allowed us to catch the early morning and evening news and to
  uncover all sorts of things we could never have known if we weren’t on
  the ground. We’ve witnessed comings and goings between Tufton St and Government
  ministers, seen them wined and dined in the house belonging to
  Cambridge Analytica’s chief techie, happened upon where Andrea
  Leadsome lives and caught her coming out of her front door early
  morning on the day she resigned. This knowledge has allowed Steve to ask searching questions and keep
  holding our elected officials to account. We’ve continued to get our
  voices and images across the news and kept Stop Brexit alive and
  helped make it mainstream. None of this has come cheaply and it has hasn’t made us popular in
  certain circles. But we know what we do is vital and that our direct
  action emboldens politicians. MPs, Peers and MEPs from all parties
  have told us that our presence really helps those politicians who are
  fighting to Remain. As Winter became Spring, we found it harder and harder to find
  affordable holiday lets in Westminster. It’s vital to keep the team in
  one place both for morale and to keep them safe. So we looked for a
  short term flat to rent on a weekly basis (rather than shipping out
  every Thursday morning to return to a different holiday let on
  Sunday). Only there weren’t any at less than £1,300 a week  (and
  believe me that's not luxurious).  However, by opting for a longer
  rental we could reduce that to £850 a week. Still horribly expensive
  but the least worst option and a proper base for Steve. To start with, the SODEM protest was just one man and a couple of
  flags grabbing a sofa from mates wherever he could. Bombing back to
  South Wales at weekends and asking favours wherever he needed them.
  Then the kindness of a fellow activist gave him a south London crash
  pad and he’s been living between there and a string of Airbnb’s since
  January. A peripatetic life on top of an already gruelling schedule
  takes its toll. Gathering a team of loyal stalwarts around him, Steve prepared to run
  a marathon, he just didn’t realise he’d be running back to back
  marathons for so long. We’ve taken the plunge and rented a home in
  Westminster for the shortest period we could which is 9 months and now
  we need to find the money to keep SODEM on the streets and fully effective. Our basic running costs have steadily increased as the campaign has
  become more high focus and more is expected of the team. While badges
  and merchandise help to fund us we need to ask for hard cash donations please. None of the protestors are paid but we do cover some expenses (such
  as travel to and from Westminster for the full timers who come up to
  London every week) and admin costs. We also need to refresh the
  placards and banners every couple of weeks to keep them topical for

"14,940",3rd Annual Romeo Athletics Charity Marathon Row OR Run,U.S. Dollar,,of $20k goal,197,"The 3rd Annual Romeo Athletics Charity Row/Run will be held on
    Saturday, June 22nd 2019 at Romeo Athletics in Enfield, CT! On Saturday June 22nd, 2019, we are
  hosting our 3rd Annual Charity Marathon Row! Numerous teams of five
  people will be rowing a marathon (42,195 meters) at Romeo Athletics in
  Enfield, CT, to raise awareness and funds to help in the fight against
  ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). We
    are requiring each team of 5 people to raise a minimum of $500.00 for this event. All proceeds will go directly to
  Tucker Wood, a family member of the Romeo Athletics community who is
  currently battling ALS. ALS is a terminal neurodegenerative disease that affects 6,000
      new patients each year, and leaves them prisoners in their own bodies . On July 7, 2016, at only 33 years old,
  Tucker was diagnosed with ALS. The diagnosis came as a complete shock
  as his only symptom was cramping in his wrist which he attributed to a
  soccer injury. The doctor shared the unfortunate news that not only is there no cure and extremely limited FDA-approved
      treatment for ALS, but the life expectancy after diagnosis is 2-5
      years. Tucker has been a preschool teacher for
  the past 12 years while also pursuing his love of photography and
  music in his spare time. He loves to travel, cook, camp and spend time
  with friends and family. His happiest and top priority, though, is
  being a father. Despite the diagnosis, Tucker and his wife, Lauren,
  welcomed their beautiful, healthy and happy daughter Eloise, in
  February of 2018. ALS affects each person differently and
  for Tucker it began by affecting the use of his left arm and then
  moved to his right. To date Tucker has minimal use of his arms and
  lacks fine motor skills within his hands. His legs are still
  considered strong, however, his gait is affected due to other symptoms
  thus making him prone to trips and falls. Due to his progression, this
  Spring represents his last year of teaching and he will be unable to
  work moving forward. Without a cure, the inevitable
  progression will continue to limit Tucker's independence. He currently
  relies on his wife or others for simple daily tasks such as dressing
  and feeding himself. Unfortunately, driving and even walking will soon
  be activities of the past. All of the proceeds from the Charity Row will go directly the
      Wood family to alleviate the mounting medical bills and the
      expensive costs associated with Tucker’s day-to-day living and
      necessary care. The estimated yearly medical cost associated with caring for an
      ALS patient in the US is $150,000-$200,000. ALS,
  like cancer, can affect anyone. Young or old. Male or female. Every
  race, religion, and socio-economic class. It doesn’t discriminate
  based on who you know, where you grew up, or who your parents were.
  Nearly 90% of ALS patients have no family history of the disease. Thank you for supporting our charity event!  You are truly
    helping to make a difference.",https://fundrazr.com/romeoathleticscharityrow
"3,653",Ride to Give - Fan for North Georgia Equine in Motion's Outdoor Riding Arena,,,,,"Amy Wallace of Cumming, GA has a passion and talent for
    helping special needs children . Amy has been an
  occupational therapist for 15 years, with the last seven focused on
  treating upper extremity injuries.  In 2010 she obtained credentials
  as a Certified Hand Therapist, and in 2013, she began combining her
  love of horses and passion for healing by offering hippotherapy and
  equine assisted therapy. In 2015, Amy started North Georgia Equine in Motion which currently serves over 100 children weekly, providing
    occupational therapy for both clinic and equine-related
  activities. Her clients typically range in age from two years
  old to 21, but she has also served adults that have MS or Parkinson’s. Hippotherapy is a standardized
  curriculum that was formulated to utilize the horse’s unique quality
  of motion for physical, occupational and speech therapy.  Sessions are
  performed on horseback, led by licensed therapists and trained
  volunteers, to facilitate improvements in balance, gait, sensory
  processing, visual and perceptual skills, problem-solving, and
  social-emotional capacities. Georgia Equine in Motion’s facility
  includes a new large arena, specially designed mounting ramp, ample
  parking and seating for guests, as well as PATH
    trained instructors. Currently Georgia Equine in Motion has four skilled therapy horses… Waylon, an 8-year-old Paint Quarter Horse Cindy, a 12-year-old Quarter Horse Jesse, an 11-year-old Haflinger Mare Chip, a 9-year-old Quarter Horse In 2014, Amy formed a non-profit agency, North Georgia
  Equine-N-Motion, to provide scholarships for children without
  financial means or insurance to cover hippotherapy, as well as,
  providing specialized equipment and covered arena to allow for
  year-long riding. These scholarships have been life-changing as the
  children who might not have been able to afford it are now able to
  participate in hippotherapy and are seeing tremendous results. Because most of her clients have unique medical requirements, Amy’s
  next big goal is to make her outdoor arena better suited to serve all
  of her children, especially those who can’t spend a long time in the
  heat. It gets swelteringly hot in Georgia during the summer and can be
  very hard on the horses and children. Many of her clients who have
  epilepsy are sensitive to heat and can experience increased seizure
  activity during the hot weather. Also, her clients with respiratory
  conditions and spinal cord injuries have a decreased ability to
  tolerate warmer environments. Amy is in need of a very large outdoor ceiling fan for the
    riding arena to assist with keeping both the horses and children
    cooler in the hot, humid Georgia weather. After much
  research, she has decided to go with a fan from Big Ass Fans® , a leader in the large fan industry. The air movement created by Big Ass Fans® can
  cool the riding area up 10 degrees as well as diluting inflammatory
  ammonia in the air, reducing odors commonly found in stables and
  riding arenas. Though big and powerful, these large-diameter
    fans are also incredibly energy efficient because they use very
    small motors in relation to the volume of air movement generated.
    The fan, once installed in the outdoor area at North Georgia Equine
    in Motion, will create a comfortable and natural environment
    allowing for more efficient training time, minimizing heat-related
    fatigue for the therapy horses and Amy's clients. Along with the
    cooling effect, Big Ass Fans® help improve indoor air quality her
    clients who have respiratory and allergy issues. When Ride to Give heard about all amazing work North Georgia
    Equine in Motion and Amy’s desire to make the environment of the
    outdoor riding arena better for her clients, we knew we had to
  help . Your donations to our fundraiser will help purchase and
  install a Powerfoil 8 from Big Ass Fans®, one of the best
  fans on the market for use in an equestrian setting . Amy is an amazing therapist who goes above and beyond for her
    clients and supporting our fundraiser for North Georgia Equine in
    Motion is a way for Ride to Give to widen the circle of those we
    help. Please help us by making a tax-deductible donation to Ride to Give. You may learn more about North Georgia Equine in Motion by

"2,195",Edina Pasic's Rescued Dogs JUNE Costs,Euro,,of €3.2k goal,37,"For the June pension costs for my dogs I need to raise 3000 Euro.
  This is a lot of money cause there are a lot of dogs who lost their
  sponsors. Some people asked me to save dogs from deathcamp Praca and
  promised that they'll pay for their cost until they find homes. But
  it's not my or the dogs fault that they were so traumatized in Praca
  and that they are in pension for over a year I don't have anyone who
  would take traumatized dogs out of Bosnia to foster care or to adopt
  them... Sadly I don't have contacts and I have around 30 dogs who are
  like that.... I don't know what to do... But I know that they would not survive on the streets or to be back
  in Praca... And I can't make anyone sponsor them if they say that they can't.... My heart breaks and I cry cause I can barely raise money for pensions
  and fosters and food for my old dogs and now I have to do it for the
  new ones who were abandoned by their sponsors.... I have had some bad luck in the past few months and i really do hope
  that it'll get better soon... It's June 5th today and that means that
  I have 25 days to raise this and that means that I should raise 120e
  per day and it sounds impossible but I have to try.... In the gallery you will find photos of the dogs who need your help.
  They just can´t lose their spots in pensions! They wouldn't end up on
  the streets after all that I've done, because the pension owners don't
  really want to wait long to get paid... All the pensions and pension
  owners are great with dogs however for them money is the most
  important.... No matter how cruel that sounds it's true.... So I am
  asking you, PLEASE help me so that they don't lose their spots... I love all of them the same the cuddly ones and the traumatized ones
  it's not their fault that they have been through so much trauma in
  this country, either from the dog catchers or Praca and it's not their
  fault that they need a lot of time to recover... Some of them even
  bark and growl at me but I love them still the same cause I understand
  what they've been through.... And sadly in Bosnia I don't have anyone in pensions who can work with
  dogs like that and there are a lot of dogs in pensions not just mine
  but from other rescuers and it's hard to give enough time to those
  dogs who need it the most some of my traumatized dogs are great with
  pension owners cause they are used to them and when they see me, they
  run and that makes me very sad... But they don't know that I rescued them.... So I am begging you all help me keep them safe and maybe if there is
  some luck I'll find someone who can help me find home for those
  traumatized dogs....Please please help me to raise this money for them
  I pay all pensions via bank accounts and I have all inovices from
  this... and if anyone wants to see them please pm me and I will send
  them...PLEASE HELP MY DOGS...PLEASE I AM VERY VERY DESPERATE FOR ALL
  OF THEM.... PAYPAL IS: andjeosarajevo@gmail.com just mark for PENSION FEES... Here is the list of dogs who need your help! 1. Leo - 80e 2. Freddy - 130e 3. Ado - 100e 4. Rosa

  this list, but they are lucky enough to have sponsors. Edina Pasic of Andjeo Sarajevo is a dedicated rescuer in
  Sarajevo who helps countless of the cities strays and needy
    animals. Andjeo means 'angel' and she is a true angel to all
    those lives she touches. As a child Edina's parents loved and helped animals,
  as Edina grew older she began bringing strays home. This love for
  animals comes from her family, her upbringing and this is what she is
  teaching her own beloved son. This sweet boy will grow up to be an
  animal advocate in the future, he will teach his friends and he will
  be their voice. What a truly amazing woman and we are honoured to know her. Edina is passionate about being a voice for the voiceless, and
  cannot turn her back on animals in need, that's why many love her
  dearly (human and furry friends alike). You may have followed many of
  her rescue missions, seen the animals get emergency treatment, being
  spayed or neutered or seen a post begging help to save them and remove
  them from their dangerous situation. Many of you may have rushed in to help, and promised to
      donate to their care, but a sad fact is that many forgot about
      these furry friends, once they were safe in pension and off the
      harsh streets. These animals still need YOU! Edina simply cannot continue without financial support to
  keep her furry family safe in pension, and in order to allow her to
  help the emergencies and animals in desperate need. She is responsible
  for many lives which is a huge strain on her, and each month it is a
  huge worry about how she will raise a huge pension fee for them. Each month a few animals are re-homed and leave their pasts
  behind them, but in order to allow them this happy ever after we must
  keep them safe in pension until that day comes. Seeing these furry
  friends leave Bosnia and be welcomed into homes around the world is
  why she continues, this is her reward for saving them. Knowing that
  they will be loved, fed and happy, that's all she hopes for. ***************************************** This fundraiser is run by friends and supporters of Edina

"1,300",Help Hunter get moving again!,Canadian Dollar,"Aug 9, 2019",of $2.8k goal,21,"Prior to his accident in 2010, Hunter was a stand-out baseball
    player. He was a very fast left fielder and batted clean-up with a
    525 batting average and received all area honors his last season. He
    was also a very talented motocross rider. This was his passion. He
    loved everything about the sport. He skillfully worked on dirt bikes
    and understood every aspect of their maintenance and how to improve
    their performance. Hunter
    was ambitious too. At the time of his accident, he was working four
    jobs, and maintaining his GPA. His goal was to attend Tennessee
    Technological University and major in mechanical engineering. Since
    his motocross accident in 2010, which left him severely disabled, he
    enjoys working with a personal trainer at the YMCA and attending a
    weekly yoga class. He also loves riding his trike bike, playing
    games, going on community outings with the Brain Injury Services day
    program, volunteering at the foodbank, SPCA and library, and going
    on family vacations. Hunter also loves to participate in endurance
    events such as 5K's, 10k's,  and half marathons. with Ainsleys
    Angels. This summer he will participate in his first triathlon, a
    Spartan race, and a Ragnar relay.  With Ainsley's Angels inclusion
    always wins #Togetherweshall !!! Though he cannot walk, talk, or remember anything beyond ten
    minutes, his goals in life have not changed. He would still like to
    go to college and get back to riding his dirtbike.  With an Alinker,
    doors would open for him. He'd be more able to get off the sidelines
    of life by walking outdoors, maybe even use it in 5k events. Hunter
    has a lot of spasticity in his legs which causes him to have a
    severe scissor gait, if you can even call it a gait. The Alinker
    could have a huge therapeutic impact as well, providing better
    circulation to the brain and by easing the spasticity in his legs.",https://fundrazr.com/11Vdqa

  Burning Man in 2014, and The Ship and Pier in 2011 and 2012) introduce
  our newest sculpture for Burning Man 2019: Head Maze. Head Maze is a 40 foot mediating mind, resting on one hand and
  ripping its face off to reveal a crystalline stained glass being.
  Inside of the mind is an immaculate interactive labyrinth of our
  subconscious and dreams. It's a massive collaboration dedicated to the
  complexities of cognition, our common struggle between body and mind,
  nature and nurture and our persistently fluctuating perception of
  self. A series of hidden doors in the mouth, wrists and head open into
  a 4 story, 18 room maze. Each 10 x 8 foot modular room creates a unique space dedicated to the
  nature of our minds, our struggles with being and the weird and
  fanciful process of dreaming. An interactive participatory playground
  hidden inside a beautiful monumental mind. Head Maze is our attempt to help everyone who struggles with their
  mind know that they are not alone, that we struggle too, and it’s ok
  to feel a little mad in this society. The Head Maze is being built by
  an incredible army of dedicated artists of all skill levels. And we
  can only do this with your help! Head Maze will premiere at Burning Man in 2019 then find a permanent
  home around California/Nevada. At the moment we have been lucky to raise a healthy $60,000 of our
  $190,000 goal. While we've been building this project in earnest, the
  most difficult challenge we will face is funding this sculpture. And
  this is where we need YOU! We did not receive a grant from Burning
  Man, big art is hard enough without the additional burden of raising
  funds. Your donation, regardless of size helps us to keep building and

  on one of the pensions so that we can move a number of the dogs there

  care for all of the dogs in out care - on the streets and in
  accommodation. We need over 3500 euros to feed over 50 street dogs and
  lodge over 60 more in pensions in the country. This is a large
  sum but it saves the lives of over 100 dogs who might otherwise be
  poisoned, hit by cars or attacked. Your support is greatly

"4,100",Partner with farmers in Malawi to save their families from starvation,Pound Sterling,"Jul 31, 2019",of £15k goal,28,"Increasing disasters such as Cyclone
    Idai are further threatening the already fragile food situation in
    Malawi, leaving many farmers unable to provide food for their
    families - increasing droughts and unreliable rain make it very
    difficult to harvest, and can drive farmers to use land close to
    rivers, more at risk from flooding. But you can partner with farmers in Malawi to enable them to
      provide food for their families in spite of increasing disasters
      by piloting a solar pump for their crops that they can build
      without external funding Eagles Relief and Development Programme 'Eagles' have been working
  with the most vulnerable in Malawi since 2003 ( http://www.eaglesmalawi.org/ ). People think hunger will end through big projects and lots of money.
  We’ve seen that doesn’t work. We know it can end through farmers, given the opportunity to use
  their creativity, who take responsibility to find their own solutions;
  and you: people who respect and treat them with dignity, believing that they can bring lasting change in their own lives .
  By giving, you become part of something that could save the lives of
    millions. What is the problem? Hunger is a devastating issue in Malawi. This year, 3.3 million
  Malawians will are at risk of starvation. 37% of children under
    5 are chronically malnourished. Irrigation is one of the best solutions as it gives a reliable water
  supply and enables a second harvest per year. However, recent
  research, including the views of farmers, has identified problems that
  prevent irrigation projects providing a lasting solution: most methods of irrigation are too expensive for farmers, leaving
    them dependent on outside help or without anything many irrigation projects only last while the organisation who ran
    the project stays as they require external maintenance many methods, such as treadle pumps, are unable to be used by the
    most vulnerable community members due to the high levels of physical
    effort to use them, including the sick, the elderly, those who are
    differently-abled and pregnant women What is our solution? Our approach to solar rope pumps meet all of these challenges, able
  to be built and maintained without external funding and used by the
  most vulnerable. Through a process of community-led design, our pilot volunteers will
  build solar rope-pumps without physical external inputs, using
  locally-available materials and upgrading them to solar when they have
  the money through village savings groups. They will be able to harvest
  twice a year, overcoming challenges of drought and unreliable rainfall
  in preparing for the regular harvest and giving access to a second
  harvest when typically there is not enough rain. We will fully build
  their capacity for its maintenance and replication, ensuring sustainability. In this two-year pilot, we want to prove that solar rope-pumps are an
  effective and sustainable way to increase food security, that they
  reach the most vulnerable and require minimal external funding. This
  evidence is vital to enable us to advocate to government, NGOs and
  private investors to replicate the approach, potentially catalysing
  change for millions of small-holder farmers across sub-Saharan Africa
  and other areas facing similar challenges. Who will benefit? We hope this approach will improve the lives of millions after we demonstrate that communities can build rope pumps
    using locally available materials and upgrade them to solar through
    savings groups, effectively improving food security without external
    funding. We will advocate to governments, o rganisations
  implementing irrigation projects a nd donors to incorporate this
    approach into their policies and practices , as well as seeing
  it spread itself through local networks. Online, all learning from the
  project will be widely disseminated and the designs made freely
  available . Without the need for external funding, the
  potential reach of this approach is huge The first to benefit will be the volunteer pilot farmers and their
  families, roughly 500 people who live in extreme poverty, below $1.90
  a day.  At least 10% will be those who would struggle with the
  physical effort required by other methods of irrigation: those who are
  differently-abled, sick, pregnant, elderly etc. The pilot village is
  in Chikwawa, a southern district that is particularly vulnerable to
  droughts. Currently those who cannot irrigate are regularly not able
  to grow enough food to feed themselves throughout the year and face starvation. Why will it work? Our innovative approach is founded on in-depth research, including a
  literature review, technical analysis & consultation with experts.
  Following an analysis of many irrigation methods, solar rope-pumps
  were identified as the most effective It builds on proven practices,
  such as the rope-pump and Eagles’ 15 years of experience facilitating
  behaviour change and partnering with the government for sustainability. Our approach is more effective and sustainable than other options,
  not only due to the low costs but due to its high potential for local
  ownership, which will ensure lasting change. We are well placed to carry out this pilot due to our 15 years’
    experience with communities and local government and technical
    expertise in key areas, including village savings and loans groups
    and the technical design and implementation of solar and irrigation technologies. The funding will cover: materials for building the prototype;
    transport to and from the village for trainings and monitoring
    visits; materials for trainings; monitoring tools (eg. equipment for
    testing pumping rates/ ground water recharge); hand borehole driller
    that communities can pass around to provide the water source;
    necessary staff salaries so they can give time to the project;
    demonstration day so we can encourage others to replicate Please email kemp_jonathan2@btinternet.com with any questions,

"6,700",Purr Pods at Burning Man 2019,U.S. Dollar,"Jun 17, 2019",of $8k goal,95,"Hello! The Purr Pods , my second
  large-scale art installation, are clawing their way to Burning Man in
  2019. This project, like last year’s Stardust , is another soothing oasis and a
  Black Rock City Honoraria Grant recipient! The Purr Pods are three large, metal, feline-shaped
  sculptures, lounging in a cluster, each in a different pose with cozy
  built-in seating. Each piece is illuminated from inside with color
  changing LEDs, some of the lights react to sound. Intense laser-like
  eyes and fiber optic whiskers give each cat a unique personality. From
  a distance, playa travelers may only see one or two of the cats at
  first but, as they get closer, they will discover the colorful
  clowder. During the day, the sculptures can provide shade as well as a
  restful place to sit. By night, the glowing eyes promise mischief and
  draw participants in to explore the curves of the cats and cuddle up
  in the bench seats. When petted, these kitties purr! My inspiration? My cats! They help me recharge when I’m feeling
  drained from too much human interaction. Petting them and feeling them
  purr in my lap is my favorite way to decompress. And it turns out
  there’s power in that purr! Power of the Purr Cats purr at luscious, vibrating frequencies, between 25 and 150
  Hertz. These frequencies are known to be therapeutic and calming. I want to create an installation that purrs and heals Black Rock City
  participants through touch and sound, transforming over-stimulated and
  stressed humans into blissed-out kitty cats. Purr Pods! Of course, not everybody digs cats. So I’d also
  like to shed some light on myths and superstitions to draw attention
  to the importance of spaying and neutering, adopting and caring for
  ferals through notes and signs placed on or throughout the installation. ""The Kitty"" - Where Do the Contributions Go? The Purr Pods received a generous grant from the Black Rock City
  Honoraria Program. I’m so thrilled and grateful…and definitely in over
  my head. Eeeee! This project is the largest I've dreamed up so far. AND it involves
  creating in so many ways that are completely new to me. When learning new things, mistakes are made. It’s part of the
  process! My mistake was underestimating my budget. The method in which
  I hope to build them has changed. Since metal sculpting is brand new to me, I’m creating wood forms to
  shape metal rod into the giant cat sculptures. These extra steps
  ensure each Purr Pod is made more efficiently. The CAD design, plywood
  and CNC costs that make this possible have exceeded the budget. The original plans included one built-in bench per Purr Pod. I’d like
  to create single seats in multiple places on each cat to increase the
  interactivity and improving the experience for participants. Transportation costs to and from the playa are also on the horizon as
  well as feeding crew members at the work parties and on playa. In
  addition, a percentage of the grant is held for deposit for potential
  services at Burning Man and to incentivize a pristine installation
  site post-event. That also reduces the amount of immediate funding for
  the build. Your Help The generous Black Rock City Honoraria Grant covers approximately 70%
  of the build so I’m asking the Burning Man community - and those who
  love us! - to help me raise the remaining funds needed to complete and
  get the Purr Pods to the playa. Thank You! Your wonderful contributions will help cover costs for additional
  construction supplies and services; create more seating for more
  people to experience the purring at the same time; secure reliable
  transportation to and from the playa; provide a cushion for unexpected
  expenses. And most importantly, you’re supporting my Zoomies (Purr
  Pods crew members) with enough tools, equipment, treats and kibble to
  make this installation roar to life. Find the Purr Pods! Facebook Instagram Twitter Flickr",https://fundrazr.com/purrpodsatburningman2019

          (+ wife), and sister (+ husband and 5 children). Today they
          are struggling to pick up the pieces of their lives, with
          literally nothing left. When the authorities evacuated this
          beautiful community, each person grabbed a small bag with the
          few things they would need for the afternoon while the fire
          department put out the forest fire nearby. An hour later, the
          fire had entered their community and destroyed everything. For more detail, see the this article from the Times of Israel . While we work to figure out the families mid and long-term

,Vault 131 - 2019,,,,,"The Vault The inhabitants of
    Vault 131 opened their doors in 2015 to share the unique libations
    they spent the last 100 or so years perfecting. Each year we run a
    low waste facility in an immersive Vault-themed atmosphere.This
    year, that same talented team of entertainers will be bringing the
    party to the Hyatt! Running such an awesome party is no easy (or
    cheap) task, and the first year is always the most expensive. In
    many ways, this will be a first year, so we invite you to join our
    fantastic team of donors and volunteers to help make the party
    happen! We have some fantastic gifts you won’t want to miss out on!! Some of Vault 131's hopes and dreams: Miraculously teleporting a survival habitat roughly 12 miles
    is no small feat, and unfortunately some of our equipment just won’t
    survive the journey or fit in our new space. We don’t want to upset
    our new overlords by getting an 8ft vault door stuck in their walls!
    This unfortunately means that the old vault door and diner booth are
    unlikely to make appearances at the Hyatt. We will construct a new secure vault door befitting the
    space and be sure to provide seating for our weary travelers.
    The new dimensions of the space also requires additional insulating panels to
    ensure we remain the most immersive and radiation resistant of
    vaults. More space also means more lighting and our engineers
    will be hard at work expanding our electrical systems to support this. After an unfortunate run-in with two trees who stole our stills
    last year (long story), we’re happy to announce that we’ve rebuilt
    and will be serving alcohol at the
    Hyatt. We’ve decided to change things up and will be offering all of
    our beverages as non-alcoholic first and allowing Wastelanders to
    pick their poison with one of our talented cocktail crafters. This
    means that we will be able to invite more Wastelanders to experience
    the best Vault-Tec has to offer but also that Vault 131 will no longer be exclusively 21+ . We intend to maintain our low waste policies in our new home
    and will be adding more reusable cups to help keep
    drink service quick and accommodate the extra guests we expect to
    host in the large space. We also intend to sort our other waste so
    that it can make it to recycling centers and/or compost piles. We hope to bring back hot ""dogs"" for
    our wasteland wanderers after a one-year hiatus. Who doesn’t crave a
    little post-apocalyptic mystery meat during a night of carousing? As
    before, a set number of these will be available each night until we
    run out. For years we’ve hoped to restore a terminal and allow our patrons the
    opportunity to play some of the many fun games we vault-dwellers
    enjoy. We are happy to announce that this is the year and
    construction has already begun! Nothing says living the good vault life quite like day drinking! To
    that end, we’ll be offering a “secret” Bloody Mary bar Friday and
    Saturday. The exact timing for this will depend our staff managing
    to drag themselves from their cots and open the doors. Once the
    doors are open, the phrase “the bloody hour has begun” will be
    posted to our FB page. Like the hot “dogs,” we’ll go until we run
    out of supplies for the day (or the staff sink into oblivion once
    again.) We’ll have movies and/or games running while you enjoy your
    restorative libations. Our dwellers are hard at work considering more tasks and
    creative improvements as we let our imaginations run wild and we
    prepare the make 2019 at the new location amazing. The limitations
    will be dependent upon our funding. What do you get? Let's face it; in the post-apocalyptic world, nothing (including
    help) comes for free. So, what will you get for your aid, in
    addition to our admiration and appreciation? We’re glad you asked: The return of your favorite party room and watering hole!
    Goodies, ribbons, special privileges, and karma boosts. All donors
    receive our ""Party Bringer"" ribbon (pictured above). For
    the most generous supporters, you can count on the envy and
    admiration of your peers at your SPECIAL social status. Our goodies
    are works in progress each year and we will be providing updates
    with pictures of them as they come together. This year we have three unique named characters available. Named
    characters receive a Fallout themed photograph of themselves mounted
    to our walls which stays up year to year. They are given an Early
    Access Pass to the bar for themselves and a guest (along with a
    SPECIAL button indicating this) and get to skip the line for
    beverage service. They will also receive bottle boy temporary
    tattoo, a collectible Vault 131 button, a Nuka-Cola bottle opener,
    and a 4-pc set of Vault 131 vault door coasters. These characters are: Overseer : Our beloved overseer comes from a
    long line of wonderful leaders all of whom enjoy their picture
    mounted on our walls for all posterity. Thus far this has largely
    remained a family affair, but you never know when a usurper will
    arrive to supplant this noble lineage. Wasteland Baron : Last year the Wasteland Baron made
    himself known and feared far and wide. This powerful outlaw has
    taken over a nearby plot of land and styled himself baron, expecting
    the utmost respect, and his demands had best be met! Thank goodness
    he mostly demands quick beverage service and minimal groveling. He’s
    the head of a gang of wasteland villains, and while he’s relatively
    new, we have suspicions that his title is given to the current gang
    leader. Maybe this year we’ll meet a Baroness? Either way, keep an
    eye out for the wanted poster and stay safe! Nuka-World Sweepstakes Winner : Nuka-world is the place where dreams
    come true! This year they held a sweepstakes for a free trip to
    their joyful theme park. We’re so excited that a regular of our
    establishment won and was kind enough to send back a postcard of
    themselves enjoying their trip! We’ve hung it up with pride and

    with one of the unique designs our team is known for. They’re
    currently being constructed so there are no finished images, but we
    will be posting updates on this as it progresses. This is Vault 131,
    where we do things right, so don’t worry that you’ll receive
    something like we heard Vault 76 tried to hand out. Our t-shirts have become CVG cult favorites, and we know why! Each
    year we come up with a new design and have them printed on high
    quality shirts you’ll want to live in. We will be offering our
    patrons the opportunity to order our previous designs this year if
    you missed out (or wore yours out like some of us did), in addition
    the new 2019 design. All perks will be available for pickup during open hours. For
    donors gaining pre-bar access, their packages will be available for
    pick-up an hour prior to official open. In some instances, shipping

    Soccer League based in Buffalo, New York. We’re more than just a
    sports team though. We believe a soccer club should be a pillar of
    its community. Since our inception in 2009 we’ve stayed true to our
    club motto, “For Our City”, and have tried to do our part around
    Buffalo. 2019 will be special, as it’s our 10th anniversary season,
    and we’re using it to renew our commitment to our city and to
    everyone that calls it home. We’ve been invited to spend part of our preseason
    this May in Germany. A major theme of our trip, through festivals
    and the clubs we will be playing, is diversity and tolerance. Soccer
    is the world’s game, and it has the incredible power to bring people
    from all walks of life together. We plan on continuing on with this
    theme when we come home, and this fundraiser is the start of it all.
    Your donations will both help support the Buffalo refugee community
    and allow us to take our staff to Germany, where they will act as
    ambassadors of our club, our city, and our country. FC Buffalo’s
    staff members are volunteers who sacrifice their time to help the
    club with everything from game day operations to community outreach. If you'd like to learn more about all of this, please
    watch our short video above. The milestones below show exactly what
    your donations will be used for. Donations prior to hitting $10,000 will be split 50/50 between

    friend and a partner in sharing the message of vaccine truth and
    risk awareness. Over the years, he has become very dear to my heart
    and an anchor during times of struggle. Tom is constantly selfless
    and generous and always reluctant to take from anyone, but now, life
    circumstances has put him in a place where he needs us to
      come together and carry him through these next difficult months . Most of you equate Tom's name as a huge source of wisdom and
    information. He has been serving the vaccine truth awareness and
    natural health and healing community sacrificially for years! When
    someone has a question, Tom has a well-researched answer ready to provide. While on vacation with his granddaughter visiting his elderly
    mother in Michigan, he needed to be transported to the hospital with
    with a hole in his aorta and an aneurysm that was growing rapidly. I
    just learned of this from his daughter last night, so I don't know
    everything. I will give more details as I have them, but I know this right now: he is in a financial crisis, and it's about to
      get worse! Even when released from the hospital in
    Michigan, he won't be able to travel back to Florida for a while,
    and he has no excess resources to cover his bills, living expenses,
    and medication! I know that many of us have benefited from his wisdom in ways that have saved us hundreds and even
    thousands of dollars as individuals in seeking treatments. Because
    of his commitment to research and keeping his files organized in
    such a way that they can easily provide answers to our questions, he
    has saved most of us countless hours looking for the answers to some
    really important questions. Please... Dig deep and give back to this incredible servant
    during his time of need. You can donate directly through this fundraiser or send him
    money directly through Facebook Messenger , which will go
    100% to him and be transferred immediately into his checking account. Thank you for your prayers and generosity to help Tom in his

  to find homes for the dogs both here and abroad. More posts to follow

"10,722",Taking Flight,U.S. Dollar,"Aug 21, 2019",of $15k goal,55,"""Taking Flight"" represents the metamorphosis of women
    leaving behind what has weakened us, speaking up, and coming home to
    who we truly are.  Connecting with inner strength, spreading wings
    and taking flight. DESCRIPTION OF INSTALLATION Nicki Adani's art installation ""Taking Flight""
    inspires viewers to claim their authentic selves, inspiring them to
    leave behind what is holding them back.  A 10-foot tall feminine
    bird-like figure, welded from raw steel rods and tubes, her wings
    spread wide, lifts off and takes flight from her perch upon a
    10-foot tall spoked wheel, representing the circle of life. 
    Participants interact by making colorful ropes and weaving them into
    the wheel as a metaphor of releasing and transforming one's past.
    Experiences already lived through can't be erased, but they can
    speak their truths, and be let go.  In the process, individuals can
    connect to their inner strength, allowing them to spread their wings
    to fly. HOW TAKING FLIGHT CAME ABOUT I like big tools. Powerful tools. At first, they intimidated me.
    But In the midst of extreme heat and flying sparks, with liquid
    metal pooling before my eyes, I have seen new life emerge from raw
    material, and an entire universe open up. The process of building
    “Taking Flight” serves as a perfect metaphor, allowing me to conquer
    my fears and persevere. I met my husband at Burning Man in 2004, and we returned almost
    every year until our first child was born.  It is the biggest
    playground and most awe-inspiring art exhibit in the world; being
    there gives me a sense of joy and freedom that I have never found
    anywhere else. I knew we would go back when the children were old
    enough to appreciate it, but until last summer, I had no idea that I
    would return as an artist. Birds and wings have been the emphasis of my sculpting work from
    the start, as they inspire a feeling of freedom and empowerment.  A
    few months ago, an image of a falcon taking flight off a giant wheel
    came to me. A second later, that image was superimposed on the
    canvas of the beautiful Black Rock Desert where Burning Man takes
    place, and I knew I had to build it. It was not until I took an early maquette to a foundry to be
    made that the image of the playa reasserted itself, and I knew that
    “Taking Flight” was not meant to sit on a shelf. It was destined to
    be a giant figure at Burning Man, carrying its meaning of awakening
    and spreading one’s wings to fly freely into the world. Once I made
    the decision, the Burning Man application deadline was due in
    exactly nine days. There was no time to waste or to second-guess
    myself. I would have to learn a million things I did not know,
    including metal fabrication. Luckily, I like a challenge so as soon
    as I got back to the studio I began to build a prototype. My dream quickly became a reality when Burning Man accepted my
    piece and awarded me a grant to get me started on bringing ‘Taking
    Flight’ to life. Not too many months from now, after days of intensive labor, my
    20-person crew (some of whom are old friends coming from overseas)
    will lay down our tools and look up at this beautiful, illuminated
    bird lifting off from its wheel, ready to spread her wings, just as
    the process of constructing her has allowed me to spread mine. BIO Nicki Adani is a Bay Area sculptor, designer and painter.  Born
    in Germany, she studied fashion design at the French Design School ESMOD, and subsequently designed for well known US fashion
    labels for 20 years. Making art was always Adani’s first love. In 2016, she began
    studying sculpture, followed by ceramics, welding and metal
    fabrication at the College of Marin. In 2018, she  spent two months working on David Best’s temple
    crew, for his temple at the Smithsonian’s exhibit “No Spectators:
    The Art of Burning Man” in Washington, D.C. “Taking Flight” set to be displayed at Burning Man 2019 explores
    the theme of struggle, transformation and emergence into something
    better -- more brilliant, more creative, more vibrant; these are
    Adani’s metaphors, as a woman, a mother, a wife and an artist,
    captured eloquently in the work she is developing for Burning Man. Like any big art installation it takes a village to create
      it.  We are fundraising to cover cost for fabrication, lighting,
      studio space, and transport to and from Black Rock City.   As we
      are building this piece in collaboration with North Bay Makers /
      180 Studios your donations will be TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Please help this installation take flight by contributing to
      our campaign and spreading the word on social media.  Thank you so much!",https://fundrazr.com/TAKINGFLIGHTATBURNINGMAN2019

  for the proper spot for an enchanted avian dwelling to roost. Finally,
  Baba Yaga's House has found her next home - Fly Ranch. For five years, Yaga will serve as a
  guardian to a 3,800-acre oasis of hot springs, cold springs, geysers,
  plant life, and animals. Nestled 20 minutes north of Gerlach, this
  breathtaking landscape is an explosion of life hidden within the Black
  Rock Desert. Our five-year installation is a rare opportunity for our community to
  come together to help place a large-scale art piece at a unique home
  for all to enjoy. Visiting Baba Yaga's House In 2018, we created Baba Yaga's House as a Burning Man Honorarium to
  bring the fabled woods witch to the austere land of Black Rock City.
  After our successful build and debut, we brought Baba's house back
  home to an art yard in Reno where she has patiently waited for her
  next adventure. Keeping in line with the folklore of Baba Yaga, we always dreamt of
  one day installing her house in a wild place on the edge of humanity.
  Our collaboration with Fly Ranch is exactly what we wished for!  This
  new site will allow Baba Yaga's House to integrate with the
  surrounding landscape where she'll spend most of her time alone with
  the land. Fly Ranch is privately-owned by the Burning Man Project
    and Friends of Black Rock host 3-hour guided nature
  walks on the property during which anyone can experience the magic
  of Baba Yaga and Fly Geyser. We are excited for visitors to spend
  quieter moments with Yaga during these intimate walks with Friends of
  Black Rock where they can fully enjoy the natural world around them
  and our ancient witch house. In our rewards, we are offering a special nature walk through Fly
  Ranch with the crew members of Baba Yaga. Our perk allows you to visit
  the Fly Ranch property and Baba Yaga with the artists who created the
  sculpture. We are also offering several spots at our art work weekend
  & celebration campout at Fly Ranch. This weekend will entail
  actually working on the sculpture and getting your hands dirty for the
  love of the witch. In the spirit of inclusivity, we are offering an ""opportunity
  drawing"" for a certain amount of spots at both the afternoon
  nature walk with our crew and the campout! If you can't donate big but
  you're OBSESSED with Yaga, don't sweat it! We want you to be there!
  You'll have a chance to test the fates closer to the dates of our
  nature walk and our campout weekend. May the luck of the woods be in
  your favor. Photograph by Trey Ratcliff The Logistics We are incredibly grateful for this opportunity to place Yaga's House
  in such a beautiful and untamed space. The non-profit Burning Man Project is supporting us with communications and logistical support
    including access to heavy equipment, power, and water. However, we
    must raise $45,000 dollars from our community to make this
    installation possible. This is your opportunity to be part of the
    next chapter in the story of Baba Yaga and we hope you’ll join us. Your donations will supply: ✶ Transportation ✶ Insurance/Legal Fees ✶ Maintenance ✶ Engineering ✶ Materials & Supplies We plan to install Baba Yaga's House in late July. This install date
  will enable Yaga fans to spend time with Baba Yaga's House in late
  Summer & Fall during Friends of Black Rock nature walks. Moving
  Yaga before this year's event will also make room for new 2019 Burning
  Man art at our current storage site. The elements at Fly Ranch can be abrasive much like the playa, with
  high winds, flooding, snow, and rain. To ensure that Baba's House
  stays safe and secure, we will visit her four times a year for
  maintenance and love. If you would like to volunteer on the Yaga

"5,365",Ingrid's Haven Winter Warmer Appeal 2019,Australian Dollar,"Sep 2, 2019",of $10k goal,91,"The Ingrid’s Haven Winter Warmer Appeal is here again for 2019. The winter chill has well and truly arrived at Ingrid’s Haven.  The
  cats have heat pads in all of their kennels and electric blankets on
  all of their bunk beds – some days these are left on 24/7 due to the
  cold outside.  With that comes a big bill in a few months’ time. To
  give Ingrid a buffer, every year we raise money to pay for this large bill. We also hope to raise money for Ingrid to do more upgrades to the
  enclosures as requested by the shire and whatever is left over will be
  put towards vet bills and the overall care of the cats (food and kitty litter). To give you some background, Ingrid relies heavily on sponsorships
  and donations that come in from the public weekly/monthly. These much
  needed funds help to pay for day to day bills – high quality food,
  kitty litter, vets, medicines, microchips, and flea/worm treatment. After those day to day expenses are paid there are big ticket
  expenses that come in and it is for this reason twice a year we hold
  BIG fundraisers….the Winter Warmer and the Christmas appeal, to ask
  for some help. The cost of keeping the cats warm can be enormous (but as you would
  all agree – an absolute necessity). So, if you can spare a few dollars it would help the kitties
  immensely – Ingrid can then sleep easy knowing that the cats will be
  warm and the bill will be paid and she can focus on the real job of
  finding them all loving, forever homes.  Please also share this Appeal
  with your family and friends. As a long time vollie at Ingrid’s Haven it is my privilege to run the
  online fundraisers to help Ingrid.  All funds donated go straight into
  Ingrid’s Paypal Account and then Bank Account. From the bottom of my heart – thank you so much for your donation to

      largest instrument and we’d love for you to join us in this
      audacious adventure! The Shrine of Sympathetic
    Resonance , a 39’ tall , 51’ foot diameter interactive
        musical sculpture built out of 90 piano harps , immerses participants in
    the phenomena of 20,000 musical strings sympathetically
    resonating the sounds they make while inside. The wonder & joy
    induced by this experience invites participants to play with their
    own sounds by singing, laughing, crying, or howling. The Space: From afar, you see five pentagonal chambers with a tower rising
    up from the center atrium. There are five arch doorways you can enter. Inside the space opens up, resembling a small open air
    cathedral. As you draw near, you see every wall is made from a piano
    soundboard – including the musical strings, metal harp, and the
    wooden frame. In the center of it all is a performance dias.  Directly above
    the stage is a five sided cupola constructed of piano harps and
    antique windows, below which hangs an elaborate chandelier. These design elements and materials are echoed in the five
    intimate chambers that surround the space. Intricate woodworking
    adorns the dais and chamber floors below, while copper patina and
    complex rope work accent the roofs. Completing our Vision for Black Rock City 2019 We have already received a prestigious grant through the Black
      Rock Arts Honorarium program. The incredible community forming around this project has also
    donated their own money, labor, tools, and other resources. This
    invaluable support would have cost us a monetary value of $98,071 if
    we needed to pay for it, but instead is going directly into the
    project. We thank our crew and volunteers endlessly! These two sources combined gets us over 85% of the way towards
    making this a reality. However, to complete this incredible offering
    and share it with the world... We need your help! Whether giving a donation of any size , helping
        spread this call out to those who can , or taking on any of the project’s many
    roles , please join our community of people making
    this happen together! How much do we have to raise? Raising $23,562 more covers: Every expense needed to complete the basic, bare bones
            version using 45 piano harps - which will be amazing! Raising $37,084 total on this site (our stretch goal) covers: The full version of the Shrine of Sympathetic Resonance
        evolving the project to 90 piano harps, greatly expanded
        infrastructure and over 20,000+ musical strings for everyone to
        play on! What if we raise more? Any funds raised beyond our stretch goal will go directly
    towards creating the most epic version of the Shrine of Sympathetic
    Resonance, incorporating all of these special projects: An intricately woven roof of mesmerizing string patterns by
        Guadalajara, Mexico based “Lotus Lamps” artist Guyphytsy Aldalai An aerial rig and an evening of performances curated by Karl

  donations we do have a fiscal sponsor. For our $10k-$30k options of
  high level perks reach out to us! And Finally, The Philosophy... For those of you who are still reading this, we thank you! The
    philosophy and meaning behind this art is really what we believe
    makes it special. Sympathetic Resonance is a phenomenon of our
    natural world that occurs when sound vibrations interact with
    objects tuned to them so strongly that these objects continue
    echoing this tone into the room even after the original sound stops.
    If this phenomenon happens within our audible hearing, does it also
    happen in frequencies beyond our hearing? What about in our actions?
    Our words? Our thoughts? And if every action we take continues to
    resonate in the world beyond our immediate effect, what ways do we
    choose to participate in the world around us? The Shrine of Sympathetic Resonance will not only help
    participants experience this magical aspect of our everyday world
    but invite them to interact and play with it by singing or crying
    into 10,000 musical strings that echo back any sound people put into
    them. But how long do these echoes last? And where do they go when
    they rise up in flames? With your contributions, we hope to find out at Black Rock
      City 2019! Donate, Share, Volunteer and Follow along www.soundcave.org . With any donation we
    invite you to come drink some champagne with us to celebrate at the
    Shrine of Sympathetic Resonance Sunday at sunset! Plus a

    old lab at home whom my girlfriend Marisa and I saved from a shelter
    when he was only four months old being here that pup was kind of
    like a connection to my dog Onyx back home. One morning I
    couldn’t find him anymore and the locals told me that he had died
    and I was completely confused, I didn’t give up on the fact that he
    was still alive so his bed stayed where it was. He finally
    showed up still alive but also very injured with tape wrapped tight
    around his leg and he couldn’t move it whatsoever, he is also very
    scared of everything now. I would love to save every single
    one of them but I know I can’t, but I will do everything I can to
    save Donny and take him home and show him the life and family he deserves.

"1,455",Bringing Play back to K,U.S. Dollar,,of $1.6k goal,18,"We have three kindergarten classrooms in our school and would like to
  incorporate more opportunities for students to participate in purposeful play . It would cost a lot more money to buy
  items for each classroom, so we would like to create one room, which
  everyone could use. This would give us the chance to get more items
  into students hands. We want to create specific areas for student
  interests so that all students can find some type of activity in which
  to engage. We all know that kids learn best through play. Play fosters
  creativity and brain development. A healthy brain needs the
  opportunity to explore and engage with the world around it. Children’s
  cognitive skills are enhanced during play. Through authentic play
  experiences children are imagining, problem solving and cooperating.
  They use language to communicate their ideas and demonstrate knowledge
  of skills they have learned and some skills they are still practicing. Here is a list of items the Kindergarten team would like to purchase. Melissa and Doug Wooden Chef’s

"3,270",Back to School,Canadian Dollar,,of $9k goal,29,"Hello Everyone, Thank you for clicking on my fundrazr  page. My name is Luisa and I am a mother of two beautiful children. I
    am currently trying to raise money to help pay for my tuition for my
    undergraduate degree. I was born in Mexico City, raised in Guadalajara Jalisco, and I
    immigrated to Canada in 2006. I have been an activist and community
    organizer since 2016. I am on my second term as a co-chair of the
    Parent Council in my children's school, and I am an active member of
    No One is Illegal-Toronto since 2016. I have a degree in visual arts
    from the Universidad de Guadalajara, and I am currently trying to
    enter the Indigenous studies and Sociology program at York
    University. My interests are advocating for residents without full
    immigration status who face significant barriers when accessing
    essential city services, such as education, emergency services,
    social housing, food banks, etc. I am passionate about social
    justice and currently volunteer with PODER Afro-Abya y Abya Yala
    Fuerza Feminista (formerly MUJER) as a member of the Programs
    Committee and JUNTXS’ coordinator. JUNTXS is a Latinx parenting
    group that aims to create a space for Latinx parents and guardians
    to share their unique parenting experiences and facilitate
    collective learning. We work from an anti-oppressive framework, and
    seek to foster empowering and judgement-free community of mothers
    and guardians to get together, support one another and generate
    social change. During the past 13 years I had had pressed pause in my
    education. It is hard to get used life in a new country, to the new
    life rhythm, language, job, adapting in general, and adding children
    to that equation made it harder for me to continue pursuing my dream
    of studying in Canada. I currently work two cleaning jobs - some at daytime when my
    children go to school and one at night when my partner comes home to
    take care of the kids. With these two jobs, I earn an income but not
    nearly enough to be able to support my family and pay my tuition. I am finally at the point in my life where I can find a way to
    start studying so that i can finally achieve my dream of studying in
    Canada. For a very long time I have dreamt that I wanted to study in
    this country: first it was to learn the language, now I want to be
    an example for my kids, who already carry so much on their shoulders
    because we chose to leave our country. They carry our accents, our
    jobs, me being a cleaner and their father as a construction worker,
    the colour of their skins, and our last names, just to name a few
    things. In going back to school, I can prove to me and them that,
    against all odds, I am very capable of this accomplishment. Going back to school, to pursue indigenous studies especially,
    will give me more knowledge and confidence to work with the
    community that I love and respect. The tuition per year for a full time student is around $9000 I
    will not be able to attend full time for the first year but this
    amount will help me to pay for required tests, the first 5 courses,
    and some needed books and supplies.",https://fundrazr.com/41W4I0

    the pretty type that makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside. It’s made of rusted metal grids
    and dilapidated damp wood that had been added on again and again to
    keep the kennels from collapsing. In some cases we have failed and
    dogs have managed to escape their kennels and get into a neighboring
    kennel. Most times this results in injury. Injuries result in unnecessary
    pain and discomfort and also high vet bills so in an attempt to
    improve the living conditions of our dogs and ensure their safety we
    need more new kennels. Sturdy and safe kennels. These old wooden kennels and

"6,365",FOOD SHORTAGE until The Bark Ark debts for food in FEBRUARY are paid,Euro,,of €6.7k goal,121,"The Bark Ark needs more than 2 tons of food per week to keep the dogs
  fed and healthy. They are outside day and night, no matter the
  weather. They need something to keep them going and the only thing we
  can provide for them is food. Without enough food there will be much
  more fights between the dogs, much more injured or even dead dogs. We
  have to prevent this!! For now the only way to save some money is to ration the food to
  smaller portions. If we can´t raise a considerable amount very
  quickly, this wonderful project is on the edge to failure. We can´t
  let that happen! More than 150 dogs find warm and loving homes
  each year and we are working on increasing these numbers. But we have
  to be able to keep them safe until then. Can you please help us to provide food for the survival of the dogs
    at The Bark Ark! Each donation helps! No amount is too small! FOOD and medical care are the basics that Bojan must provide
      for the over 600 dogs at The Bark Ark until they found a new
    home. They come from a hard life as strays on the streets
    of Prnjavor, Samac, Celinac, Modrica and other cities in Northern

"4,788",Ride to Give - Fan for North Georgia Equine in Motion's Outdoor Riding Arena,,,,,"Amy Wallace of Cumming, GA has a passion and talent for
    helping special needs children . Amy has been an
  occupational therapist for 15 years, with the last seven focused on
  treating upper extremity injuries.  In 2010 she obtained credentials
  as a Certified Hand Therapist, and in 2013, she began combining her
  love of horses and passion for healing by offering hippotherapy and
  equine assisted therapy. In 2015, Amy started North Georgia Equine in Motion which currently serves over 100 children weekly, providing
    occupational therapy for both clinic and equine-related
  activities. Her clients typically range in age from two years
  old to 21, but she has also served adults that have MS or Parkinson’s. Hippotherapy is a standardized
  curriculum that was formulated to utilize the horse’s unique quality
  of motion for physical, occupational and speech therapy.  Sessions are
  performed on horseback, led by licensed therapists and trained
  volunteers, to facilitate improvements in balance, gait, sensory
  processing, visual and perceptual skills, problem-solving, and
  social-emotional capacities. Georgia Equine in Motion’s facility
  includes a new large arena, specially designed mounting ramp, ample
  parking and seating for guests, as well as PATH
    trained instructors. Currently Georgia Equine in Motion has four skilled therapy horses… Waylon, an 8-year-old Paint Quarter Horse Cindy, a 12-year-old Quarter Horse Jesse, an 11-year-old Haflinger Mare Chip, a 9-year-old Quarter Horse In 2014, Amy formed a non-profit agency, North Georgia
  Equine-N-Motion, to provide scholarships for children without
  financial means or insurance to cover hippotherapy, as well as,
  providing specialized equipment and covered arena to allow for
  year-long riding. These scholarships have been life-changing as the
  children who might not have been able to afford it are now able to
  participate in hippotherapy and are seeing tremendous results. Because most of her clients have unique medical requirements, Amy’s
  next big goal is to make her outdoor arena better suited to serve all
  of her children, especially those who can’t spend a long time in the
  heat. It gets swelteringly hot in Georgia during the summer and can be
  very hard on the horses and children. Many of her clients who have
  epilepsy are sensitive to heat and can experience increased seizure
  activity during the hot weather. Also, her clients with respiratory
  conditions and spinal cord injuries have a decreased ability to
  tolerate warmer environments. Amy is in need of a very large outdoor ceiling fan for the
    riding arena to assist with keeping both the horses and children
    cooler in the hot, humid Georgia weather. After much
  research, she has decided to go with a fan from Big Ass Fans® , a leader in the large fan industry. The air movement created by Big Ass Fans® can
  cool the riding area up 10 degrees as well as diluting inflammatory
  ammonia in the air, reducing odors commonly found in stables and
  riding arenas. Though big and powerful, these large-diameter
    fans are also incredibly energy efficient because they use very
    small motors in relation to the volume of air movement generated.
    The fan, once installed in the outdoor area at North Georgia Equine
    in Motion, will create a comfortable and natural environment
    allowing for more efficient training time, minimizing heat-related
    fatigue for the therapy horses and Amy's clients. Along with the
    cooling effect, Big Ass Fans® help improve indoor air quality her
    clients who have respiratory and allergy issues. When Ride to Give heard about all amazing work North Georgia
    Equine in Motion and Amy’s desire to make the environment of the
    outdoor riding arena better for her clients, we knew we had to
  help . Your donations to our fundraiser will help purchase and
  install a Powerfoil 8 from Big Ass Fans®, one of the best
  fans on the market for use in an equestrian setting . Amy is an amazing therapist who goes above and beyond for her
    clients and supporting our fundraiser for North Georgia Equine in
    Motion is a way for Ride to Give to widen the circle of those we
    help. Please help us by making a tax-deductible donation to Ride to Give. You may learn more about North Georgia Equine in Motion by
      following them on Facebook . *Contributions are solicited with the understanding that the

"3,766",Help Refugees Rebuild Their Lives in Iowa,U.S. Dollar,,of $10k goal,50,"Today is World Refugee Day, and a group of Franciscan Sisters
    just gave the Iowa City Catholic Worker House a $10,000 gift to
    further our work helping asylum-seekers from around the world find
    safety in the United States. Their award is a testament and recognition of the quality of the
    services we have demonstrated and our good work to date sponsoring
    refugees and helping them rebuild their lives in Iowa. In the last two years, we have housed dozens of women and
    children from all over the world. We work closely with human rights
    groups on the border to win freedom for asylum-seekers being held in detention camps , reunite them
    with their families if possible, and help them find a new home here
    in the U.S., starting in our sanctuary community in Iowa City. Ten thousand dollars is a great start to all the new work that
    is currently in front of us, but we need you to give today –
    anything you can – to match this single gift as a collective
    response from our entire Catholic Worker House community. With all of your gifts combined, we want to match the $10,000
    the Franciscan Sisters have so generously and prayerfully bestowed
    upon us to serve the immigrant and the stranger in our midst. Your
    gifts will allow us to do the following: Mount a robust asylum legal defense for a Honduran widow and
      her disabled son, who fled the country last year on foot with the
      Migrant Caravan. Pay legal fees for an expecting El Salvadoran mother so she
      can stay in the country with her baby, who will be born a U.S.
      citizen any day now; as well as for her husband, who was deported
      to Mexico after they were both detained at the border. Sponsorship costs to free several Honduran men from the
      detention camps at the border. These young men are all married but
      were forcibly separated from their wives, have strong asylum
      cases, and verifiably good characters. Other costs and expenses associated with refugee sponsorship
      and resettlement, including 1) transitional housing, 2) medical
      and prenatal care, 3) education and school enrollment, 4) English
      tutoring, 5) extracurricular activities, 6) transportation, 7)
      culturally-appropriate food and clothing, 8) religious services,
      and more. General support for all aspects of the hospitality ministry
      that makes our refugee sponsorship possible, including maintaining
      and upgrading our historic Victorian home, Free Little Food
      Pantry, weekend soup kitchen, and open house, drop-in center hours. Will you join the Franciscan Sisters’ prayerful and powerful
    witness on World Refugee Day and give today? Please donate now - and know that your gifts will be stewarded
    in the fashion we have already demonstrated to help these refugee brothers and sisters in Christ. God bless you, Emily Sinnwell, David Goodner, and Araceli Benitez

"17,975",Support Entrepreneurs in Tanzania!,U.S. Dollar,,of $25k goal,35,"Kernal Angus Adventures is a ragtag band of merry adventurers who travel the world when
    they can, seeking genuine experiences with genuine people. We are
    not afraid to take risks in order to move past “that can’t be done
    here” or “that’s not possible there” and always try to enrich the
    places we visit, leaving them better than we found them. This year, we are climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro and attempting to
      break two Guinness World Records in the process: “Highest Altitude
      Dance Party on Land” and “Highest Altitude Fire Breathing,” in
      order to bring attention to the need for economic empowerment in
      this part of the world. For many generations, seasonal coffee picking was the only
    employment opportunity available to families living in Oldeani, an
    area located in a remote corner of northern Tanzania, in the heart
    of the great Rift Valley. With the lack of opportunity leading to
    annual incomes under $150, parents were left helpless in the fight
    against generational poverty. Too often children had to drop out of
    school or work long hours on top of their studies in order help
    their family make ends meet. Recognizing that economic empowerment is critical to breaking
    the cycle of poverty, the Tanzanian Children's Fund launched their Microfinance Program in 2008 to ensure that
    families in that area could prosper. Today, they are helping more
    than 720 entrepreneurs provide for their families and put food on
    the table. With access to increasing loans, foundational business
    support, and initiatives like their handicrafts project, average
    incomes in the area have more than doubled. We would like to help
    them build on this success by supporting and expanding their loan fund. Our gift to Tanzania, the country through which we will
      travel, is the creation of the Kernal Angus Adventures
        Microloan Fund . A fund that will be administered by the TCF, who will use the
    money raised to provide their 720 clients with additional loans to
    grow their businesses and to expand their loan portfolio to more
    individuals in future years. We will be visiting the Children’s Village and meeting the
    founders of TCF, which has received 4 stars on Charity
    Navigator. We will work with their team to ensure that they
    provide detailed management, oversight and accounting for this fund,
    which is designed to provide funds for many years to come. And, by special arrangement with TCF, all funds received will be
      put directly towards providing loans! We believe there is no greater gift than helping people become
    self-sustainable and realize their potential, and the best way to do
    that is to help them get a fishing pole instead of a fish!  We hope
    that this trip will help bring awareness to this vital need and that
    you will join us in seeking to provide “better lives to good

"3,200","Help our youth fight stigma, discrimination, and violence",Canadian Dollar,,of $7.5k goal,13,"Mixed Company Theatre produces innovative, socially relevant
    drama as a tool for positive change.  Founded as an artist-run
    collective in 1983, this nationally recognized not-for-profit today
    uses Forum Theatre and interactive arts to educate, engage and
    empower audiences in schools, communities and workplaces. Read more
    about us here: www.mixedcompanytheatre.com For 35 years, Mixed Company Theatre has worked with youth who are
  marginalized and who seek a safe space to share their stories! Through
  the years, our powerful educational interventions and theatre-based
  social justice projects have celebrated the voices, needs, and desires
  of these youth, many of whom have identified as homeless, disabled,
  unemployed, mentally ill or facing other severe social, cultural and
  psychological barriers. As we celebrate our 35th anniversary, we
  stand on the cusp of implementing new ideas, innovative artistic
  interventions, and high quality low-cost projects for our youth to
  address the discrimination, harassment, and stigma that they continue
  to face in their everyday lives. This year we need YOUR help to reach 2000 more youth with our 2 exciting arts-based projects: In Your Head: Forum Theatre tour to address the stigma of mental illness An estimated 1.2 million children and youth in Canada
      are affected by mental illness . Given the high prevalence
    of mental health problems, it is important to consider the immediate
    environment of children and youth, and adapt these environments to
    make them supportive, re-assuring and de-stigmatized zones of
    influence in the young person’s life. Our new project IN YOUR HEAD,
    a Forum Theatre play written by Luciano Iogna, will tour community
    centres and schools to bring marginalized youth together as a
    community to discuss, analyse and rehearse practical, day-to-day
    actions that will create an empathetic and inclusive “zone of
    influence” for mentally ill youth. We had a successful run of this
    important theatrical endeavour addrssing the stigma of mental
    illness and reaching youth across 5000 youth across GTA schools! And
    we're all set to do more with your help. School Lightning Forum Theatre Lightning Forums are MCT's brand new approach to creating a
    platform for intensive learning and exploration for youth. This
    project is founded on the key principles of Forum Theatre that
    celebrate community participation, critical inquiry, and
    experiential learning. This highlight of this project is that
    schools and youth get to choose the topic/they want to focus which
    means youth can build awareness, empathy, and skills to address a
    wide range of relevant themes including bullying, LGBTQ+
    discrimination, gender-based violence and many more. Your support will help us take these innovative arts-based
      educational initiatives to 2000 marginalized youth and build
      dialogue around these important social justice and equity themes. All contributions will receive a tax receipt! How exactly will your funds be used? The $7500 you help us raise will help us compensate artists engaged
  in this unique theatrical endeavour according to industry standards,
  and in turn provide quality programming for youth. How will the $7500 be spent? The ratios below reflect how your contribution will be used towards
  artist fees for youth programming: Playwright Royalties: 9% Director Fees: 10% Actor and Designer Fees: 55% Facilitator and Stage Manager Fees: 18% Transportation and Travel: 8% What impact will your support make? 2000 more youth will learn skills to listen, empathize, analyze
    and stand up for each other when it matters 2000 more vulnerable youth will have access to a safe platform for
    learning, dialogue, and action to address pressing social themes of
    stigma towards mental illness, LGBTQ2S discrimination, and
    gender-based violence Mixed Company will continue to build its capacity to offer high
    quality educational programming to marginalized populations who
    might not be able to cover full artistt fees We want to thank you! All contributors will receive a tax receipt. You will

    unflinching detail, to pave a path of stunning strength and
    unapologetic joy into the wider community we all call home. Shot in
    three acts, with the first two completed. This is a film that gently

    embrace the journey that carry’s us from isolation to connection,
    from connection to true belonging. This film tricks the mind through visual story telling, into a
    wider landscape of possibility. It begs for you to inhabit your body with unapologetic enthusiasm and to bring your
    brilliance to the fore. Inspiring us to engage in the brave work and
    difficult conversations that enable us all to push beyond the upper
    limits of pleasure, potential and power we have been taught by society. This is a story about pushing back against learned helplessness
    and externally imposed limitations born out of true ignorance,
    intense love polluted by deep fear and lack of imagination for what
    is truly possible for ALL people. This is truly about seizing the moment by virtue of simply being
    oneself, an amplifying agent of healing for the world at large. Please join me in supporting her today - this tour is going to

"2,010",African Grass Root Hoops 2019 Youth Day Classic Fundraiser,U.S. Dollar,,of $8k goal,17,"African Grassroot Hoops ( AGH ) is a basketball
  development NPO that grows young leaders by providing programs and
  opportunities to support young people from the age of 9 to 18 years in
  developing a sense of competence, usefulness, belonging and
  empowerment through BASKETBALL. This June AGH will be hosting its annual Youth Day Classic
    Basketball Tournament, at the Cape Town International
  Convention Centre. Teams pay for their participation but that is not
  adequate to cover the costs of hosting a tournament of this
  magnitude. It will cost $8000, to build-up the basketball court floor
  and install baskets, which was the biggest hurdle to overcome in
  hosting our first tournament last year. Through this 2 day initiative, our players will learn important
  social skills, strong interpersonal skills, and instil a sense of hope
  in the future all while fostering meaningful relationships with their peers. Funds will be directly spent on: Installation of the basketball court floor and the baskets at the
    convention centre. $7000 Train local community members to assist on the day to ensure
    smooth operations/running of the tournament. $1000 In a country where the majority of young people are overcoming
  stressors in their lives, such as poverty, discrimination, abusive
  situations, addictions, unstable homes, and poor academic performance
  due to injustices of the past, we at AGH, like Nelson Mandela, believe
  that “Sports have the power to change the world. It has the power to
  inspire, the power to unite people in a way that little else does. It
  speaks to youth in a language they understand. Sports can create hope,
  where there was once only despair. It is more powerful than
  governments in breaking down racial barriers. It laughs in the face of
  all types of discrimination. Sports is the game of lovers” With your support, we can continue to grow and scale a platform that
  seeks to foster positive changes through goal setting,
  self-discipline, skill development, and sportsmanship! Your funding will go directly towards funding our Youth Day Classic 2019! Thank you so much for your support! Umuntungumuntungabantu. Meaning I

"20,440",3rd Annual Romeo Athletics Charity Marathon Row OR Run,U.S. Dollar,,of $20k goal,278,"The 3rd Annual Romeo Athletics Charity Row/Run will be held on
    Saturday, June 22nd 2019 at Romeo Athletics in Enfield, CT! On Saturday June 22nd, 2019, we are
  hosting our 3rd Annual Charity Marathon Row! Numerous teams of five
  people will be rowing a marathon (42,195 meters) at Romeo Athletics in
  Enfield, CT, to raise awareness and funds to help in the fight against
  ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). We
    are requiring each team of 5 people to raise a minimum of $500.00 for this event. All proceeds will go directly to
  Tucker Wood, a family member of the Romeo Athletics community who is
  currently battling ALS. ALS is a terminal neurodegenerative disease that affects 6,000
      new patients each year, and leaves them prisoners in their own bodies . On July 7, 2016, at only 33 years old,
  Tucker was diagnosed with ALS. The diagnosis came as a complete shock
  as his only symptom was cramping in his wrist which he attributed to a
  soccer injury. The doctor shared the unfortunate news that not only is there no cure and extremely limited FDA-approved
      treatment for ALS, but the life expectancy after diagnosis is 2-5
      years. Tucker has been a preschool teacher for
  the past 12 years while also pursuing his love of photography and
  music in his spare time. He loves to travel, cook, camp and spend time
  with friends and family. His happiest and top priority, though, is
  being a father. Despite the diagnosis, Tucker and his wife, Lauren,
  welcomed their beautiful, healthy and happy daughter Eloise, in
  February of 2018. ALS affects each person differently and
  for Tucker it began by affecting the use of his left arm and then
  moved to his right. To date Tucker has minimal use of his arms and
  lacks fine motor skills within his hands. His legs are still
  considered strong, however, his gait is affected due to other symptoms
  thus making him prone to trips and falls. Due to his progression, this
  Spring represents his last year of teaching and he will be unable to
  work moving forward. Without a cure, the inevitable
  progression will continue to limit Tucker's independence. He currently
  relies on his wife or others for simple daily tasks such as dressing
  and feeding himself. Unfortunately, driving and even walking will soon
  be activities of the past. All of the proceeds from the Charity Row will go directly the
      Wood family to alleviate the mounting medical bills and the
      expensive costs associated with Tucker’s day-to-day living and
      necessary care. The estimated yearly medical cost associated with caring for an
      ALS patient in the US is $150,000-$200,000. ALS,
  like cancer, can affect anyone. Young or old. Male or female. Every
  race, religion, and socio-economic class. It doesn’t discriminate
  based on who you know, where you grew up, or who your parents were.
  Nearly 90% of ALS patients have no family history of the disease. Thank you for supporting our charity event!  You are truly
    helping to make a difference.",https://fundrazr.com/romeoathleticscharityrow

    community. As always, the temple is a place to grieve, give thanks,
    let go, connect, renew and reflect.  Thousands upon thousands of
    people walk and sit either alone or with their closest friends as
    they leave hand-scribed messages, photographs, poems and deeply
    connected personal items behind. The Temple holds this honor for all
    to mourn, grieve, and even celebrate significant milestones in their lives. The Temple of Direction is designed by Geordie Van Der Bosch,  a
    San Francisco based Architect. His vision for a temple is a linear
    interior with two main entrances. Each entrance leads through a
    tunnel to the main hall. Dense wall space creates ample surface for
    temple visitors to leave messages and place items. If the man is the heart of Burning Man, the Temple is it’s soul.
    The tradition of the temple is one of love and honor. The role of
    Temple Builder is a sacred post that Geordie has accepted with equal
    parts grace and glee. The logistics behind the Temple of Direction are considerable.
    Construction will begin in San Francisco, transition to Reno and end
    on the Playa. Our fundraising goals are ambitious.  Your financial
    contribution will bring the temple to the residents of Black Rock
    City and we thank you. The Temple is supported in part by a grant from Burning Man. The rest
  is up to us: the volunteer crew and the entire community. This
  campaign is dedicated to pay for the costs lumber, steel bolts and
  fasteners, transportation of materials, and much needed tools to
  safely and accurately construct this solemn space. In addition, a
  portion of this fundraiser is earmarked for infrastructure during the
  month-long build in August on the playa. The Temple of Direction will be co-creating with the following collaborators. The Koi Pond The Koi Pond is a large-scale interactive light sculpture that

"2,115",Help Donny get from Afghanistan to the USA!,U.S. Dollar,,of $5k goal,67,"Donald's Soldier Savior says: My reasons for wanting to save this pup are simple, I can’t
    stand to watch an animal suffer, being here in Afghanistan it’s
    really heartbreaking having to see these animals on the streets
    starving and being killed. They are helpless, I met this pup
    no more than five months old following me around while I was
    working, he really grew on me and my employee Jay started feeding
    him and taking care of him and I named him Johnny I have a two year
    old lab at home whom my girlfriend Marisa and I saved from a shelter
    when he was only four months old being here that pup was kind of
    like a connection to my dog Onyx back home. One morning I
    couldn’t find him anymore and the locals told me that he had died
    and I was completely confused, I didn’t give up on the fact that he
    was still alive so his bed stayed where it was. He finally
    showed up still alive but also very injured with tape wrapped tight
    around his leg and he couldn’t move it whatsoever, he is also very
    scared of everything now. I would love to save every single
    one of them but I know I can’t, but I will do everything I can to
    save Donny and take him home and show him the life and family he deserves. Donations via check can be mailed to: Nowzad Dogs NFP, 2770 Main Street #161 Frisco, Texas, 75033, USA Please include the animal that you would like to donate to in your mailing.

    allocated to support the vital daily operational costs of the Nowzad
    Dogs small animal clinic and shelter in Kabul. The total required for a companion animal to travel to North

"1,100",Help Heidi #keepmoving with an Alinker walking bike,Canadian Dollar,,of $2.8k goal,17,"Hiya For those that don’t know me, I’m Heidi. In 2000, I was diagnosed
  with RRMS. It was horrible news... I was always active; Loved playing
  tennis, bike riding, avid hiker, worked full time... just lived life.
  Multiple sclerosis changed my life- I began to lose mobility in 2008.
  I use a wheelchair for ‘walks’ on a groomed nature trail, but with the
  Alinker bike I could WALK! Imagine me walking eye-level! [no more
  butt-level] The mobility alone is exciting- using my legs! This bike would support my body when my legs are further weakened.
   This would have such a hugely positive impact on my mental &
  physical health. Best of all? I would be able to walk Rommel. [He is
  my 10yr old German Shepherd/Soulmate. He has been with me through it all] I am grateful for my wheelchair, though it’s not a perfect
  fit for me. I have some/limited use of my legs, they’re just
  weak, & I have coordination issues. This bike would allow me to
  use my legs, & keep moving! ...a rolling stone... This fundraiser is for one walking bike, shipped to me. Thank ya kindly- Heidi",https://fundrazr.com/d1WFI9
"2,040",Help Save Duke the Dane Puppy!!,U.S. Dollar,,of $5.5k goal,47,"Well I guess you could say we were in the right place at the
    right time. This little guy is Duke, a 12 week old Great Dane puppy
    who is in really rough shape. We had the mom with the litter of Jack
    Russell mixes at pet emergency when this little guy we found out
    needed help desperately. He appears to have suffered from some form
    of blunt force trauma to his chest and possibly his leg, causing
    fluid build up around his lungs in his chest cavity. He is in really
    rough shape and needs help. The owners surrendered him to the rescue
    so that we could do what we could to save his life. We need help
    with this one folks!!! Dukes bill is over $4000 right now and
    climbing. If you can donate any amount it would be very
    appreciated!!! Please share!!",https://fundrazr.com/a1WJu6
"1,271",Hurrithon 2019,U.S. Dollar,,of $6k goal,39,"Who We Are: We are the Hurricanes! The Hurricane Swim Team is
    a family-friendly summer swim team in northwest Austin. As a member
    of the Northwest Swim Circuit, our mission is to provide a
    structured recreational activity where your child can learn the
    value of competition, sportsmanship, teamwork, and individual
    achievement, as well as make new friends while getting a great workout! What Is The Hurrithon? Each year we host a
  hurrithon. Swimmers will swim as many laps as possible to raise money
  for the Hurricanes. There will be 2 types of prizes this year: the
  most money raised and the most laps swam per age group. When Is the Hurrithon? The Hurrithon will be held Tuesday, June 4th at our pool
  during regular swim practice. All laps will be swam this day. However,
  donations will be accepted through June 30th. Why Are We Raising Money? As
  Winston Churchill said, ""We make a living by what we get, but we
  make a life by what we give."" Did you know we are 100% volunteer run? Our registration fees are very low and don't
  cover the full expenses of running a swim team and hosting meets. We
  raise money to offset these costs in order to keep registration fees
  affordable so all kids have the opportunity to swim with the Hurricanes. Our fundraising goal this season is $6000 .
    Every dime of our Registration Fees are spent on our Coaching Budget
    and our fixed costs: Pool use fee and a new $600 lane line. So, we
    must fundraise for everything else, and this season we'd like to
    replace some equipment. We need a new shed, new computers, some new
    tents, and to contribute to resurfacing (or replacing) of the
    starting blocks. (Blocks are the property of the pool.) Help us raise $6000 by June 30th. NOTE: Please indicate WHICH SWIMMER/S your
    donation should be credited to, so we can track the totals. Thank
    you for supporting us!",https://fundrazr.com/Hurrithon2019

"1,010","Help Alexis aka ""Gramma"" fight for the youth and women of the DTES!!",Canadian Dollar,,of $2k goal,14,"Hey Folks! I am asking you to make a MASSIVE and potentially LIFE CHANGING
  impact on some well deserving young people and STRONG women and
  mothers in the DTES and around the East Vancouver COMMUNITY. This is a
  call out for you to help me RAISE $2000 for them so lets GIVE EM WHAT
  WE GOT!! I'll tell you a little story of how I ended up in Aprons for
  Gloves. A year ago I would never have imagined this for myself, but
  here I am. Alexis. A queer wannabe Tina Turner turned boxer. You can
  call me Gramma. About 6 months ago I heard that Eastside Boxing Club was
  inviting frontline workers to train at the gym for free and so I came
  down for a class. I was immediately taken aback by the supportive
  community of people there, it was not the intimidating environment I
  had expected a boxing gym to be. People were so welcoming from the
  moment I got there and boxers were training and genuinely encouraging
  each other. That first class was TOUGH! I remember my arms felt like
  they were going to fall off and still, I was totally hooked. In a very
  short time, boxing has changed the trajectory of my life. I only hope
  that in this I can pass on even a piece of the confidence and love it
  has given me. I've been doing outreach and harm reduction work in the DTES and
  all around Vancouver for the past 3 years. The experience has brought
  its fair share of challenges, grieving and joy and during this time I
  have met some of the most creative, caring and resilient human beings
  who like anyone, just need some support and someone (hopefully you!)
  to believe in them. When I was a teenager I struggled with addiction
  and homelessness and was bounced around from youth shelter to group
  home. My life lines and the people I will always remember, were the
  basketball coaches that bought me shoes so I could play in the
  tournaments, the dance teachers who let me attend their classes for
  free because they saw something in me and the programs akin to what
  Eastside Boxing Club provides. This is personal! So lets help people
  THRIVE not just survive because we can do better! WHERE DOES YOUR MONEY GO? So. Aprons For Gloves. Here's the deal. I train harder than I've ever
  trained in my life at Eastside Boxing Club for the next 3 months.
  Theres even a chance that I might get matched for a fight in the ring
  for my enjoyment  and your entertainment. YOU DONATE all the money you
  can to AFG to remove barriers and help fund programming for women,
  moms and at risk youth. These programs offer an opportunity for young
  folks and women to come and not only box but to build community and
  support that they may not otherwise have access to. All your donations
  go directly to the programs. There is so much more to boxing than what
  you might think and so much to be gained from being involved in this
  community. Did you know that Eastside has a doctor come in bi-monthly
  so that folks have access to medical care!? They suit these folks up
  with all the gear they need to train, provide them with tutors,
  mentorship and peer leadership programs all based on financial
  contributions from our community so please please donate to the cause
  and spread the love!! And please share this page with your friends,
  loved ones, coworkers and neighbours!! A HUGE thank you in advance for your donations, caring and support!! I would like to acknowledge that I am living and learning on
    the unceded, ancestral, and occupied, traditional lands of the
    xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), Səl̓ílwətaʔ (Tsleil-Watuth),  and

  amazing children, one 17 year old son and a 20 year old daughter who
  is in University.  I have a walking, sitting,and standing disability
  which makes life a little complex. This would change my life, would
  strengthen my legs and improve my well-being. My mobility has been
  impacted for almost three years compounded by Joint Hypermobility
  Spectrum disorder, three failed hip scope surgeries to correct FAI

  hamstring. A new diagnosis of femral retroversion mean that I am going
  to get better! But this device will be crucial in preparation for this
  long surgery road. I am struggling to continue to work full-time, and failing most of
  the time.  It's difficult to get around and I think that this mobility

"141,500",Southaven CoC: Blackwell Family Medical Expenses,U.S. Dollar,,of $150k goal,926,"Hi everyone, as most of you know Don & Sheri Blackwell were
  involved in a serious 4-wheeler accident while Don was holding a
  Gospel Meeting out of town. Don and Sheri both suffered fractured
  vertebrae during the accident. Don's injuries are severe and have
  likely resulted in permanent damage. Fortunately, Sheri will recover
  from the injuries she sustained, but both will have a long recovery
  ahead of them. The Southaven church of Christ is organizing a crowdfunding
  campaign to help assist with the Blackwell's medical expenses that
  will no doubt be significant. Because they were out of town when the
  injury occurred we tentatively believe insurance will kick in to cover
  50% of the cost associated with treatment for their injuries.
  Estimates from the Christopher Reeves Foundation suggest the first
  year cost to deal with similar injuries to be in excess of $500,000.
  The ongoing costs associated with such injuries can be in excess of
  $65,000 per year. This campaign is intended to help the church raise funds that will be
  used to help offset some of the costs that the family will incur. Many
  people will consider the cost of the immediate hospital bills but may
  not think about the many costs that will be associated with all of the
  adjustments that will need to be made for the family's future living
  arrangements. The elders at Southaven will also be accumulating any
  funds sent to the Southaven congregation and earmarked for the
  ""Blackwell Fund"" to help offset these expenses as well. If
  you would prefer to send donations this way you can send them to:
  Southaven church of Christ, PO Box 128, Southaven, MS 38671. The church at Southaven and the family appreciate your prayers and
  support during this difficult time.",https://fundrazr.com/a1V5q6
"2,500",Kim Munn's Cuddle Bear Drive Benefiting Texas Children's Hospital The Woodlands,U.S. Dollar,,of $2k goal,46,"Usborne Books & More is excited to partner together with Kim
    Munn to run a Cuddle Bear Book Drive benefiting Texas Children’s
    Hospital in The Woodlands, TX. What is a Cuddle Bear Book Drive? Usborne Books & More has a
    book and plush set called Cuddle Bear that is all about bringing
    comfort through hugs. Together, the plush and bear help bring those
    hugs to life! Our goal is to raise funds to be able to purchase at
    least 90 Cuddle Bear sets to be distributed to patients at Texas
    Children’s Hospital. Each Cuddle Bear set costs $25…but Usborne Books & More
    provides a 50% match making your donation dollars go even further.
    In addition, Usborne Books & More also donates 5% of each
    purchase of a Cuddle Bear set to The Scott Carter Foundation. In
    2018, the company was able to present Scott Carter’s family with a
    check for $25,000 to go towards pediatric cancer research. Texas Children’s Hospital has profoundly impacted Kim and her
    Family’s life: “October 17, 2017, was a day we will never forget. We went into the appointment to find out our baby’s gender -
    however, it was suddenly darkened when we were blindsided with the
    life changing news that our Sweet Baby Girl had the worst form of a
    neural tube defect called Spina Bifida, where the brain and spinal
    cord do not fuse together in the early gestational days. She would
    likely have a large spectrum of disabilities including loss of
    mobility, bowel and bladder issues, and would require a shunt (drain
    valve) in her brain – requiring repeated future surgeries. Then GOD GAVE US HOPE. Hope through Texas Children’s Hospital. After evaluation, we qualified for an experimental surgery, only
    offered by Texas Children’s Hospital. The surgery would repair our
    baby’s back in-utero at 25 weeks gestation – greatly improving our
    baby’s quality of life. That weekend we named our baby, Annie Hope. Annie was the 46 th case and successful 37 th surgery to undergo the Minimally Invasive Fetoscopic Repair
    Surgery, and the repairs changed her world. Annie is our Miracle –
    thanks to GOD through TCH. At her One year appointment she was cleared of never having to
    need a shunt in her brain, her bowel and bladder control are
    perfect, and she will walk. Annie will be taken care of by TCH until
    she is 18. We know Annie’s outcome would have been completely different had
    it not been for Texas Children’s Hospital and they will forever have
    a place near and dear to our Family’s hearts.” Your Contribution will go towards purchasing a cuddle bear and
    book for the patients who need a pick me up in their day. This
    seemingly small gesture reminds families who are struggling to find
    peace and joy, that there is HOPE and LOVE. Thank you for helping us
    give back to Texas Children’s Hospital in Annie Hope’s name!",https://fundrazr.com/81WG32
"1,548",Help Jamaica Maroon Indigenous Women's Circle Build Peace Circle Arbor,U.S. Dollar,,of $2k goal,16,"We are Maroon Indigenous Women's Circle of
    Jamaica, based in Asafu Yard , Charles Town Maroon Village. We are building our own designated meeting, event, and classroom
    space for wellness, healing, training, restorative justice council
    and cultural education courses to promote emotional and spiritual
    empowerment for our women, girls and youth. We are raising US$2,000 to build a covered all-weather
      enclosed arbor that will be our Peace Circle
      Arbor , right under our sacred Peace Tree where
    Maroons have been gathering upholding our Afrikan values for
    hundreds of years. Our goal is to have the Arbor built and ready for our wellness
  segment for this year's Charles Town Maroon Conference and
  Festival that will take place June 20-23.  We approximate  2 weeks
  for collection of materials, labor, and finishing touches to
  completion by June 17, 2019. The Mission of Maroon Indigenous Women's Circle is to be the
    memory of Afrikan families and communities, remembering traditional
    values and customs we have lost or forgot, to uplift and improve the
    lives of women, girls and youth, to preserve, protect, transmit and
    promote African retention, and to use our traditional heritage of
    arts and creativity to restore order as we envision compassionate
    families and communities, willing to take responsibility and be
    positive role models for our present and future generations. Currently, we host our events in  Asafu Yard which is a shared
    large open space for community activities.  This is not a
  private space for us to hold the kinds of rituals and programs that
  requires intimacy, sensitivity to the issues of violence, rage, and
  other issues we work with.  We also circle in the home veranda of our Gaama MaMa G Gloria Simms, our
    Paramount Queen of the Maroons .  Though we love this space, it
  is small and not appropriate for public events. The nature of our initiative requires that we have designated spaces
  to host, circle, and cultivate the healing tools and skills necessary
  for growing our traditional knowledge and cultivating safety for those
  who come and work with us on very sensitive issues.  This year we are
  prioritizing restorative justice for our youth to offer rites of
  passage programs that allow them to process rage and grief, and learn
  new ways of communicating through mentorship with maroon women. We want our new facility to have sitting walls with hinges that open
  for storage; have a bamboo fence to keep out animals and have a
  semblance of privacy during our events and rituals; to have partial
  concrete flooring on certain parts, and a locked and covered walk-in
  storage shed for our materials and tools. Your contribution today will take us to the next level as we continue
  to serve our community with our new Peace Circle
  Arbor . $2,000 to construct our very first building of a Peace
      Circle Arbor will allow us to host all-year programs to support
      our community with anti-violence programs, empowerment trainings,
      and plant seeds for cultivating more of our indigenous
  wisdom. Every dollar you donate will go towards
  resiliency of our women, girls and youth.  Please share our campaign
  with your friends far and wide. The Peace Circle Arbor building will be approximately 1,200 square
  feet (30'x40') and will cost $2,000 Total Materials Needed                           $1,000 8 foot cedar posts $350 wood for roof beams, seats $250 concrete, sand, nails, hinges $100 bamboo for fencing $200 zinc for roofing $200 Total Labor by maroon builders:            $1,000 Total cost of Peace Arbor Building      $2,000 One sample idea of the arbor design that would surround the Peace
  Tree.  Ours  would be much larger scale with box seating that has
  hinges and opens up.  We would build a walk-in storage off to one of
  the sides of the arbor. Sample idea of Seated bench with storage inside of Peace Circle Arbor: Sample idea of bamboo fencing around Peace Circle Arbor (ours may be
